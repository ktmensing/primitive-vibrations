		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC</strong> – Mark G. Anderson Consultants ("MGAC"), a leading independent provider of owner's representation and project management services, announced today they have been selected to manage the relocation of  a government agency headquarters proposed for the new Founders Square development in the Ballston neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.  This entity is a critical research and development organization.

MGAC is recognized for its quality work on many high profile projects for corporate, institutional, cultural, and public sector clients.  In addition to this client, the firm has provided project management services for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Education, multiple programs for the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense Concessions Committee and is currently working on both the DC-based headquarters and the
national field and satellite offices for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The firm managed over $1bn in construction value in 2008 alone for clients including Eaton Corporation, Salamander Hospitality, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, and the Council on Foreign Relations.

This project marks the second significant Northern Virginia headquarters relocation for MGAC in 2009.  In March, MGAC was selected to manage the worldwide headquarters relocation of Hilton Hotels Corporation from Beverly Hills, California to Fairfax County, Virginia.  Mark Anderson, President and the firm’s founder, stated, “We are proud to be working with a superior organization like DARPA.  DARPA is a group of highly accomplished thinkers and innovators, and we are humbled by the trust they have placed in our organization.”

This rapidly developing project will be completed with DARPA’s relocation to a new highly efficient building to be constructed in Arlington County, Virginia.  “Our business is built upon working with world-class organizations such as this client to achieve their organizational objectives with a timely and value driven approach,” Anderson commented.  “It is a distinct honor to provide our expertise in support of this prestigious agency, located right in our backyard.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from Charlotte Observer</h6>
Facing a fast-changing media landscape, Time Warner Cable is building a new data center in Charlotte that aims to provide better, faster service for an array of electronic gadgets.

The telecommunications giant said Monday that the expansion of its corporate campus off Arrowood Road will bring 225 new jobs to the city. The project also includes an additional office building.

The new jobs will have an average salary of $61,044, well above the county average of $51,584. The jobs are in information technology, engineering, human resources, accounting and finance.

Company officials hope the data center will allow the nation's second-largest cable provider to remain competitive on a wide range of devices as the world's technological landscape continues to change.

"It's a way for them to stay ahead of the curve," said Jeff Kagan, a tech analyst who covers cable companies. "Competitors are numerous now ... and that's just going to continue."

The announcement, which drew Gov. Bev Perdue and other officials, means Charlotte becomes an even bigger employee hub for the New York-based provider of cable television, Internet and phone services. It's also the latest example of a technology company receiving state tax incentives to plant a new data center in North Carolina.

The 178,000-square-foot data center, expected to be completed by the end of next year, will be one of two Time Warner national data centers in the U.S. Time Warner said the center would allow the company to provide faster and more reliable service to any device, mainly its core products of voice, high speed data, video and commercial services. Construction is expected to begin in the fall.

"Consumers need the advanced services now," said Carol Hevey, executive vice president of operations for Time Warner's east region. "The technology is available and ready to deploy to consumers, and helps us to deliver content to consumers anywhere on any device."

The other new project, the 103,500-square-foot office building, is expected to be completed in 2013. It will house the new employees, with hiring expected to be completed by 2014. Charlotte employs more people in these kinds of positions than other offices across the country, company spokeswoman Melissa Buscher told the Observer on Monday.

The corporate campus currently employs about 1,200. Almost 3,000 are employed across Charlotte and 6,400 across North Carolina. Besides adding employees, the company in 2008 raised its profile in the city by putting its name on the uptown arena that's home to the Charlotte Bobcats.

The expansion project represents a $101 million capital investment in Charlotte. Since it came to Charlotte in 2002, Time Warner Cable has invested more than $200 million locally.

The company received a Job Development Investment Grant for the project, making it eligible for up to $2.9 million in state funds throughout the next nine years if it meets annual performance targets.

It's the third such state grant the company has received. The first, received in 2004, required Time Warner Cable to create 350 jobs and invest $28 million. It ended up creating more than 400 jobs and invested more than $31 million, according to the N.C. Commerce Department. The second, received in 2008, required creation of at least 200 jobs and a $3.7 million investment.

The company has been fulfilling requirements and continues to be eligible for grants, Commerce Department spokeswoman Kim McCarl said.

For the latest expansion, the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have jointly offered $2 million in incentives for the project.

N.C. becomes data hub

Time Warner Cable is the latest company to build a data center in North Carolina, providing the infrastructure needed to power growing websites, software applications and new devices.

In 2007, Google announced plans for a $600 million facility in Lenoir. The company received $4.8 million from the state and could receive more than $100 million in total benefits. They will eventually employ more than 200 people.

Two years later, Apple announced a $1 billion data center in Maiden, in Catawba County. The company received $21 million in incentives from the city and county after the N.C. legislature approved $46 million in tax breaks for the company. It is expected to create 50 jobs and another 250 jobs in areas such as maintenance and security.

Facebook's $450 million data center in Rutherford County, announced last fall, will generate 42 jobs when it opens next year. The social networking giant is also eligible for tax breaks from the state and can receive up to $11.4 million in incentives from the county.

The growing and expanding information technology field means more companies are competing on more devices, with each working to provide the best services. Time Warner's new data center, for example, will play a large role in the continued development of the company's application for Apple's iPad, released earlier this year.

"There are so many new technologies, and many that won't be in existence in a few years because they're going to grow and change," said Kagan. "If Time Warner doesn't transform itself, it's going to fall behind."

Time Warner Cable serves more than 14 million customers throughout 28 states and employs more than 47,000 people across the U.S. Although the company lost 66,000 video subscribers, its profit still increased to $325 million in the first quarter of 2011, a 52 percent jump from 2010. Revenues from high-speed data rose 11.3 percent, the highest increase in subscription revenues.

Time Warner stock closed Monday at $77.78, down about 1.8 percent. The company's stock price is still up from a low near $65 at the beginning of the year.

David Jones, president and CEO of Charlotte-based data center provider Peak10 Inc. and a member of the board of the N.C. Technology Association, said the state's reliability and supply of power, reasonable prices, state grants and business-friendly atmosphere is a draw for companies looking to build data centers.

"It's also going to attract more talent to Charlotte and provide incentives for more training around IT solutions, the center is going to support their applications," he said.

A growing presence

At a news conference Monday, Perdue and Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners Chairman Jennifer Roberts stressed the importance of high-paying, technology-related jobs in Charlotte's future.

"We know that information is the currency of the 21st century and access to that information is extremely important to making sure all our citizens have access to good information ... in whatever they want to do," Roberts said.

The governor also dreamed aloud about her hopes for Time Warner Cable's future in Charlotte.

"Since I'm a paying customer, I need to tell you that I've got one big item still left on my wish list," she said. "I dream of the day when we're standing here ... and we get to say 'Charlotte, N.C., corporate headquarters for Time Warner Cable.' "

Time Warner Cable spokeswoman Buscher said while the company has greatly enjoyed Charlotte, there are no immediate plans to relocate its headquarters from New York.

Cindy Green-Ortiz, a program manager in enterprise information security who has worked for Time Warner Cable for 15 years, said expansion in Charlotte has only been positive.

"I've worked here for a long time, and to see it grow and get added to is wonderful," she said. "We'll definitely be very, very busy making that operation work, and we like to be busy."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from Data Center Knowledge</h6>
North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue is getting plenty of experience unveiling new data center projects. Today Perdue announced that <strong>Time Warner Cable</strong> will invest $101 million in an expansion of its campus in Charlotte, which will include a 178,000 square foot data center. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012, but will be designed so that Time Warner Cable can double the size of the data center to accommodate future growth.

“Time Warner Cable looked around the country, and they chose North Carolina,” said Perdue. The project adds to a growing list of data center wins for North Carolina, which includes facilities for <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/category/archives/2011/05/06/archives/2007/01/19/google-picks-nc-for-600m-data-center/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/category/archives/2011/05/06/archives/2010/02/22/first-look-apples-massive-idatacenter/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/category/archives/2011/05/06/archives/2010/11/11/facebook-plans-north-carolina-data-center/">Facebook</a>,<a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/11/16/wipro-confirms-north-carolina-data-center/">Wipro/Infocrossing</a>, <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/05/20/american-express-to-build-in-north-carolina/">American Express</a> and perhaps <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/06/02/report-disney-buys-land-for-nc-data-center/">Walt Disney</a>.
<h3><strong>INCENTIVES HELPED CLINCH DEAL</strong></h3>
As in the earlier data center projects, North Carolina offers generous incentives to the company – in this case, a state grant from the Job
Development Investment Grant program that could yield $2.9 million in benefits if the company meets its job creation goals. Time Warner Cable (TWC) says its expansion will add 225 new jobs at an average salary of $61,044 a year, although some of those jobs will likely be based at an office building included in the project.

The expansion is part of a broader shift by Time Warner Cable to feature more managed hosting and cloud computing services. Earlier this year TWC <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/02/01/time-warner-buys-navisite-for-230-million/">bought NaviSite</a>, paying $230 million to acquire a service platform, 10 data centers and 1,200 customers.

Those data centers are apparently not enough. The new Charlotte facility will house 1,600 racks of technical equipment on a 12,000 square foot raised floor. The building offers a virtual cloud environment, allowing for quicker deployment of TWC’s products, which include video, high speed data and commercial services by having storage and network elements in a shared environment.

“The National Data Center allows TWC to focus on delivering services for customers with greater effectiveness and reliability and with less cost and environmental impact,” said Jim Ludington, executive vice president of national network operations and engineering, Time Warner Cable. “Opening a data center in Charlotte underscores our commitment to provide the best mix of technology necessary to service our customers.”

Power and cooling vendor <strong>Eaton Corporation </strong>recently opened two new data centers, located in Louisville and Simpsonville, Kentucky. The facilities showcase Eaton’s strides in energy efficiency and will upgrade the company’s global data center infrastructure. Eaton expects to realize $23 million in energy savings due to the improved efficiency of the new data centers.

Eaton has housed most of its server, storage and network infrastructure in two data centers located near Cleveland, Ohio. One of the facilities is 43 years old, the second is a third-party leased facility, and both are beginning to run short of space and power.

“Our new data centers are energy efficient by design, deploy Eaton’s most sophisticated power management technologies, and support our company’s growing data processing needs while conserving energy and water,” said Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer. “As a power management company, finding innovative ways to enable our customers to reduce energy costs and to use power more efficiently, effectively, and safely is central to Eaton’s mission.”
<h3><strong>GOLD LEED CERTIFICATION</strong></h3>
Eaton’s data center in Simpsonville, Kentucky received LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold Certification, as rated by the US Green Building Council. The Louisville site is expected to be certified later this summer because the two facilities are identical.

Eaton;s new facilities feature its 9395 Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS) and new 400V ePDU product to extend the capabilities of its UPS technology line, allowing users to run servers at 230V increasing efficiency and reducing distribution costs.

To monitor and manage energy use, Eaton deployed its Foreseer Enterprise Power Monitoring software, which works in conjunction with building management systems (BMS) to provide a comprehensive and “real time” view of the electrical, mechanical, life safety and security systems. The cabinets in the data halls feature Eaton’s Wright Line Heat Containment System (HCS) technology.

Here are photos from the new data centers:

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwire - October 28, 2009) -  <a href="https://www.mgac.com/">Mark G. Anderson Consultants (MGAC),</a> a leading independent provider of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/profile.php">owner's representation</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/services.php">project management services</a>, is proud to announce that the Council on Foreign Relations' (CFR) Washington, DC building was recently awarded LEED gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The <a href="http://www.cfr.org/">Council on Foreign Relations</a> (CFR) is an independent, nonpartisan membership organization, think tank, and publisher dedicated to helping shape the foreign policy choices facing the United States and other countries. MGAC served as the project manager for the entirety of the award winning project.

Located at 1777 F Street NW, the renovated building incorporated two previously existing buildings, a Victorian-style townhouse completed in 1871 and a modern concrete and glass building built in 1981. MGAC partnered with architecture and design firm Mancini•Duffy, and construction began in November 2007 and was completed in December 2008. "The LEED certification of our Washington building is an important validation of CFR's commitment to environmental responsibility. It is a smart thing to do, as energy savings will more than pay for the additional costs associated with reaching LEED gold status. It is also the right thing to do," said CFR President <a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/3350/richard_n_haass.html">Richard N. Haass</a>.

MGAC acted on behalf of CFR to manage the people, organizations, and processes involved to study the existing building, map out the desired program, confirm major elements / systems to be renovated, identify what elements could be creatively utilized, coordinate utility upgrades, execute the design process, and manage the purchase of construction contracts so that the client's goals were met.

MGAC acted as the conductor for the service providers and contractors (22 organizations were involved), and communicated issues and major decisions to the client throughout the seven month design process, and twelve month construction period. MGAC also handled the furniture procurement and move coordination process, to ensure a smooth transition to the new building, while coordinating with multiple departments at the NY headquarters. The project was delivered on time and under budget. MGAC also worked closely with the client after move-in, to ensure all punch list work was complete and all systems functioning as intended. "We're thrilled with the building and not just because it was on time and under budget, but also because of the quality of the job," Haass added.

MGAC is recognized for its quality work on many high profile projects for corporate, institutional, cultural, and public sector clients. In addition to CFR, the firm has provided project management services for Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, University of California, Center for American Progress and several embassies in Washington, DC, including the House of Sweden, the Royal Norwegian Embassy and the Embassy of Liechtenstein. The firm managed over $1 billion in construction value in 2008 alone for clients.

Mark Anderson, President and the firm's founder, stated, "We are proud to have helped a world-class organization like CFR achieve their goal of LEED gold. The achievement of LEED status further cements CFR's status as a world leader in energy and climate change policy."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fannie Mae’s technology center has realized a total of $1.7 million in energy savings ─ a 35 percent cost reduction ─ as the nation’s first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified data center marks its fifth anniversary.

The 247,000 square-foot data center represents the cornerstone of Fannie Mae’s technology operations. The LEED designation, awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in June 2005, recognized a number of energy-saving innovations. A unique irrigation design that uses wastewater from the cooling plant and captured rain water, coupled with landscaping that features drought-tolerant plants, helps the facility preserve nearly 13,000 gallons of municipal water per day from consumption and waste and has saved more than 23 million gallons over five years. During construction, the facility also used materials that were manufactured in the region and recycled 80 percent of the construction waste.

“When it was decided that Fannie Mae’s data center should be constructed to meet LEED requirements, there was a host of challenges for the architects and engineers because there was no previous model to follow,” said Edward Watson, executive vice president of Operations and Technology. “We’re pleased that the energy-saving features that earned the prestigious LEED certification have helped Fannie Mae be more environmentally responsible and cut costs as well.”
<div>Construction of data centers present special energy challenges as processing equipment demands significant real-time electrical power, in addition to power redundancy, which is critical to ensure that equipment can continue functioning under adverse or unanticipated conditions.</div>
Rick Fedrizzi, president, chief executive officer, and founding chair, U.S. Green Building Council, said: “Fannie Mae’s early adoption of LEED not only demonstrates their environmental stewardship but can attest to the simple premise that by consuming less, companies inherently save more and will do so throughout the lifecycle of the building.”

The LEED rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. LEED certification distinguishes building projects that have demonstrated a commitment to sustainability by meeting the highest performance standards.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sourced from the Council on Foreign Relations

The <a href="http://www.cfr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Council on F</strong><strong>oreign Relations</strong></a> (CFR) is proud to announce that its new Washington, DC, building was awarded LEED® gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and was verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the nation's premier program for the design, construction, and operation of high performance green buildings. Only some 3,400 buildings nationwide are LEED certified.  Of these, 1,100 of them have achieved gold certification (the second highest level of certification, behind platinum). In Washington, DC, approximately sixty-eight buildings have been LEED certified and only thirty-three have achieved gold certification.

"The LEED certification of our Washington building is an important validation of CFR's commitment to environmental responsibility. It is a smart thing to do, as energy savings will more than pay for the additional costs associated with reaching LEED gold status.  It is also the right thing to do," said CFR President <a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/3350/richard_n_haass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Richard N. Haass</strong></a>.

The building project was led by the architecture and design firm Mancini Duffy and managed by Mark G. Anderson Consultants. Construction of the building began in November 2007 and was completed in December 2008. The office relocated to its new address near the White House in January 2009.

The building, located at 1777 F Street NW, incorporated two previously existing buildings-a Victorian-style townhouse completed in 1871 and a modern concrete and glass building built in 1981. "What makes this achievement so extraordinary is the fact that the project refurbished two existing buildings, one of which had a protected historical façade, and added a third, modern façade to tie the composition together," said Mancini Duffy's LEED-accredited Design Principal <strong>Anik K. Jhaveri</strong>. "It is rare for renovation of existing structures to be awarded LEED gold certification."

The process for obtaining LEED certification is based on accumulating points in five areas: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality. Some of the steps CFR took to achieve gold certification included:

-  Recycling seventy-five percent of construction debris, thereby diverting it from landfills.

-  Planting water efficient landscaping, expected to result in a fifty percent reduction in water use.

-  Installing a rainwater capture system to store 5,000 gallons of diverted rainwater to use for irrigation and washing of sidewalks.

-  Replacing all windows and adding new insulation throughout to reduce utility use.

-  Utilizing twenty percent recycled materials in renovations, including carpeting and furniture fabrics.

-  Using Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified woods for millwork, paneling, and furniture. FSC is dedicated to promoting sustainable forestry practices throughout the world.

-  Setting up air filtration inside the building to minimize the amount of dust produced during construction, thus making the worksite healthier for workers.

-  Installing automated lighting controls throughout the building to reduce energy use.

"With each new LEED certified building, we get one step closer to USGBC's vision of a sustainable built environment within a generation," said <strong>Rick Fedrizzi</strong>, President, CEO, and founding chairman of USGBC. "CFR is an exemplary model of high-performance design and function that makes an immediate and positive impact on our planet."

The building was also recognized with a 2009 Green Building of America Award from <em>Real Estate &amp; Construction Review</em>, and Mancini Duffy received the Award of Excellence for Best Renovation from the Maryland/DC chapter of NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association. The building was also designed to earn the Energy Star, the joint U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency program that recognizes energy efficient practices by businesses and homeowners.

The building features ample natural light, flexible space for both large and small events, state of the art conference technology, and a healthy working environment for CFR members and staff. Most of the building's meeting spaces, including its 250-person conference room, intimate board rooms, and terraces, are available for rentals for external events.

CFR's historic headquarters in New York is also committed to decreasing its environmental footprint. This year, with support from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the building will be undergoing an energy survey aimed at increasing energy efficiency over the long term.

"I could not be more pleased with the LEED certification and all the Council's environmental efforts. We believe that going green in our buildings is the perfect complement to our important intellectual work in the realm of energy and climate change policy," said Haass.

</strong></h6>
<strong>TYLER, TX.-</strong> The Tyler Museum of Art is one step closer to building its new home. The Museum’s Board of Trustees has named the award-winning team of <strong>wHY Architecture</strong>, led by Yo-ichiro Hakomori and Kulapat Yantrasast, as its principal design architect on the new TMA facility, Director Kimberley Bush Tomio announced.

<strong>wHY Architecture</strong> is a Los Angeles-based firm with a stellar track record in museum design on projects including Michigan’s Grand Rapids Art Museum, the Art Bridge spanning the Los Angeles River in southern California, and numerous galleries for the Art Institute of Chicago. Yantrasast, the firm’s executive/creative director, previously had served as project architect on the team of Pritzker-Prize winning design architect Tadao Ando for the 153,000-square-foot Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, which opened in 2002 to international acclaim.

Yantrasast joined forces with Hakomori to form wHY (an acronym for Workshop Hakomori Yantrasast) in 2003, and immediately landed a major assignment to design the Grand Rapids Art Museum (GRAM). The 135,000-square-foot facility was praised by Newsweek as a “calm and cool modernist building” and opened in October 2007 to glowing reviews from a host of national publications including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and Architect Magazine.
“This talented young team created a building beyond our expectations. In every detail, the facility was better than we had hoped,” GRAM Director Celeste Adams said. “They were sensitive to our objectives and knowledgeable about art museums, and we found it to be an extremely satisfying experience to work with them. They are great architects, and are destined for a great future.”

Eleanor Cameron, chairman of the TMA’s Building Committee, said the Board of Trustees took heed of the acclaim Hakomori and Yantrasast received for the GRAM project – bolstered by the Building Committee’s trip to Grand Rapids to view the team’s most recent project in person – and quickly grew confident that the Tyler Museum was on the right track to selecting an architect who would envision a successful marriage between the Museum and its community, and to let the new building design emerge from its environment.

“In wHY, we know we have hired the right team to work with our vision of what we want the TMA to be for future generations; to find that elusive balance between the needs of the Museum, the possibilities of our building site, and the goals of the city of Tyler,” said Mrs. Cameron, who is also one of the Museum’s founding members. “Each of the internationally recognized, award-winning candidates we considered and interviewed brought impeccable credentials and a compelling vision to the table. But what put the team from wHY over the top for our Board of Trustees was its tremendous record of achievement in design for cultural institutions throughout the country – and the firm’s level of sensitivity to the context of our project. It came down to who could manage the goals we laid out – and wHY was it.”

In addition to its striking design, the GRAM also continues to receive considerable praise as the first new museum construction in the U.S. to receive Gold certification by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Rating System, which provides independent, third-party verification that a building project meets the highest green building and performance measures. The TMA also plans to pursue LEED certification in its building design, with the goal of becoming the first new art museum facility in East Texas to meet that standard.

“The new Tyler Museum of Art must emerge as a civic symbol from the context in which it grows to reflect the history and nature of the local community of Tyler,” Yantrasast said. “This building should fulfill the mission and program needs of the Museum, and yet be a testimony to the highest cultural achievements of our times in a greater global sense. Our philosophy is harmonious with the Museum’s objectives, and we are excited about this opportunity to imagine this new facility, which we anticipate will grow organically from this beautiful land and from the art that will be housed and appreciated within this place for the community, for many generations to come.”

In September 2007, the TMA finalized the purchase of approximately 13 ½ acres of heavily wooded land, on the southeast corner of the intersection of University Boulevard and Lazy Creek Drive in Tyler, as the site of its expanded new facility. The Museum then invested several months in developing a program for the new building, and selecting an owners’ representative on the project to assist the TMA in managing the complex undertaking.

The Museum has engaged the services of Mark G. Anderson Consultants (MGAC), an international leader in the management of design and construction projects, to provide project management services for the design and construction of the new facility, which will aim to achieve LEED certification for its sustainable design and construction.

“We are honored and privileged to be participating in such an innovative new project that will be both LEED certified and architecturally significant, and will have the Tyler Museum of Art poised for the future,” said Mark G. Anderson, president of MGAC.

The current facilities for the Tyler Museum of Art are located in a 15,000-square-foot building adjacent to the Tyler Junior College campus. The Museum was designed by E. Davis Wilcox and completed in 1971 with funds raised by the Junior League of Tyler, which then donated the building to the TMA, and sits on land leased from Tyler Junior College.

“We would love to stay where we are,” Mrs. Tomio said, “but the building, which itself was an award-winner when it opened, is landlocked from expansion on the north, west and east sides by the TJC campus and by property to the south. The Museum now has more than 800 objects included in its Permanent Collection, and is scheduled to receive several hundred additional works as a promised gift from the Laura and Dan Boeckman Collection of Mexican and Latin American Folk Art. Add to that the continued growth of our Education Department, the need for more galleries to showcase major exhibitions, the lack of a true lecture hall for our programs, the attendance we see increasing with each special event, and offers from various sources to donate more artwork to the Museum, and it’s obvious we simply have outgrown our current space.”

Once a conceptual design is completed and final costs are determined, the Museum will announce the campaign goal and construction schedule for the building project.

“The new TMA will enable us to provide more programming in myriad ways, and better fulfill our mission not only to serve the community – but to provide a cultural destination for the entire region,” said Steve Manley, president of the TMA Board of Trustees. “Several major donors already have stepped forward to pledge their support of this vision, and early projections of the final cost indicate the goal is attainable. The enthusiasm so far has been tremendous, and we are confident our community will be proud of the outcome in every way.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A seemingly innocuous topic, yet one that elicited no small amount of debate within our company. Generally, the more gray-haired set opposed the idea, while the millennials and near millennials were all for it. But why step into this?

In the final analysis, we chose to enter the fray as a means of communicating the current issues and realities that we run across in our everyday work here at MGAC. While our corporate reach varies greatly by client, geography, and need, there is commonality in the experience and concerns that arise. We ultimately decided that by sharing this information, the dialogue and discussion surrounding these topics could be furthered. Our intent is to provide our observations of these commonalities and industry cross-sectional opportunities. We will never mention any client or project, nor will we reveal our business transactions or dealings.

So, in this first post, one of the commonalities that we’re seeing is the use of social media and new technology. At MGAC we have varied our workspace (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYqXDUYx3GI">see the attached video</a>, courtesy of OTJ Architects), are changing our technology platforms to provide more tablet-based computing, and are working to provide greater flexibility for a variety of work styles. Choice, flexibility, collaboration, and communication are buzzwords we all recognize – and this blog is directed toward those goals.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Easy answer:  the blender. I find the individual components of a milkshake are not nearly as compelling as the blended result.

I was in a meeting last week and, during the project review, a potential client asked me how we address diversity. We asked the client to clarify whether they were referring to project diversity (minority and disadvantaged business participation on what will be a $100m ground up project) or diversity internal to MGAC. The client’s response was, “what does diversity mean to you?”

Notwithstanding MGAC’s track record of attracting and meeting diversity requirements and participation levels on major projects, diversity is near and dear to the essence of our firm; hence the milkshake/blender analogy. MGAC’s individual components are not nearly as interesting as the accumulated diversity, harmony, and sometime discord of our staff. The strength of any group, I believe, is directly proportional to the diversity of opinion, lifestyles, ethnicity, and education.

We are finding that our clients are asking us to manage projects across six continents, working in multiple languages. Fortunately, with MGAC professionals sporting wildly diverse backgrounds that include fluencies in Polish, Mandarin, Spanish, French, German, and a smattering of Russian, we have the makings for some interesting cultural and professional mixtures. Milkshakes are so much better than their component parts, and that’s part of what gets me back to the blender each and every day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In one morning’s newspaper, I ran across two separate articles. The first described a Richard Neutra home in LA that was being sold for close to $16m, while the second talked about a Richard Neutra building that was being abandoned and demolished. Being a dinosaur, I still read newspapers and, in fact, pay for them. And, perhaps that means that like certain random pieces of architecture, newspapers only hold value for a short time before being recycled.

Anyway, the dichotomy of value between those two buildings – designed by one of my favorite mid-century modernists – and the fact that this was conveyed in a single day’s news, was striking. For someone like me who has made his living around, and whose passion has always rested in, buildings and construction (as a seven-year-old, I played in the tunnels that are now Judiciary Square Metro station), this begs the question: <em> Is architecture toilet paper or timeless art?</em>

Early in my construction life, while still a general contractor, I was scarred by a singular punchlist experience. The architect had gotten down on his hands and knees, looking for paint blemishes behind built-in files and under desks. The punchlist period lasted longer than any one of us could have anticipated, and cost my project its profitability. We had done a great job, received compliments from the owner, delivered on time, and the quality standard was excellent. We’d worked hard, completed the punchlist, had a happy client, didn’t make any money, and then twelve months later, the client organization was acquired and the ultra high-end space we had sweated and toiled over was filling a demolition dumpster on its way to a landfill. Hmmm. TP or timeless art?

The answer is, of course, more complex. Stewart Brand tells us that buildings learn. Business-purposed architecture and construction must adapt and change in tandem with organizations and their evolving needs. During the design and construction process, understanding what is timeless and what needs to be flexible and readily changed is crucial to achieving best value and business outcome.

In our business we aspire to achieving art where merited, but can also do a quick and effective double-ply. Okay, that was flippant; we don’t really do toilet paper, but we’re good at whiteboard art, and at understanding that needs change and art can be sometimes erasable. We know to bear in mind during the design and construction effort, that flexibility in a business or building’s life cycle is crucial. And, when we’re lucky, we get to look back on a beautifully framed masterpiece.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC</strong> – Mark G. Anderson Consultants (“MGAC”) announced today that it has acquired Dougherty Partners, a Manhattan based, full service real estate development and construction management firm specializing in retail development. Dougherty Partners has worked with many of the nation’s top retailers on national rollouts, high-end flagship stores and the new trend of pop-up stores.

The acquisition will allow MGAC to open a Manhattan office to service retail and corporate clients with local expertise in the New York metropolitan and Northeast Corridor markets. Dougherty Partners has worked for some of the nation’s premier brands and leading retailers including Godiva, Brooks Brothers, Levi’s, Spanx, Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa, Ann Taylor and C Wonder. MGAC retail clients include Chop’t, OfficeMax, Pacific Sunwear, and Discovery Channel.

"MGAC’s clients are the biggest winners in this acquisition because the strength of our two organizations will deliver better business outcomes than ever before," said Mark G. Anderson, president of MGAC. “In today's highly competitive retail environment, success frequently depends on a retailer's ability to manage multiple concurrent projects across a wide geography. Our world-class provision of Program Management services is capable of providing a single point procurement from project estimating through design to construction and punch list. Together with Dougherty Partners, we can enhance our Program Management platform to take our clients’ initial visions from concept to prototype to national and international rollouts.”

Tom Dougherty, founder and president of Dougherty Partners, concurs. “MGAC’s singular commitment to their clients is an ideal fit for us. Their passion, energy, perseverance and quality service are all trademark elements that Dougherty Partners shares. Dougherty Partners was attracted to MGAC because of their bi-coastal and international presence. The fact that the firm has a deep resume of international projects is an added bonus. By joining forces with MGAC, we will have the resources to further expand MGAC’s reach in an increasingly global business environment.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC</strong> –<strong> </strong>Mark G. Anderson Consultants ("MGAC”) was recently selected to deliver Owner’s Project Management services for the construction of a state-of-the-art performing arts and teaching centre at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The $63 million Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts (“IBCPA”) is being designed by the internationally acclaimed Norwegian architectural firm Snohetta jointly with the Ottawa firm ema Architects, and will be situated near the university on the shore of Lake Ontario. MGAC Vice President Michael Grey, OAA, MRAIC, MBA, LEED AP (also Managing Director of MGAC's new Toronto office) is leading the Project Management effort with expert support from in-house colleagues who collaborated on the $100M, 190,000 SF, 2,000-seat Strathmore Music Center project in Bethesda, Maryland.

The IBCPA will be the new home of the Queen’s Department of Film and Media, and will provide valuable teaching, rehearsal and performance space for the Queen’s Department of Drama and School of Music. A 560-seat acoustically superior concert hall will be the centerpiece of the IBCPA. With this outstanding concert hall and the other performance and teaching spaces, the performing arts centre will enhance the artistic and cultural life of the university and the wider community.

The project was funded largely through a generous donation from two of Queen’s most distinguished alumni, <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/badercentre/baders">Drs. Isabel and Alfred Bader</a>. The City of Kingston and the governments of Ontario and Canada also contributed funding to the project.

<strong>Time Warner Cable</strong> today cut the ribbon on an $82 million data center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 178,000 square foot facility houses 1,600 racks and four 12,000 square foot data halls. The data center, which was announced last summer as part of a $101 million expansion in Charlotte, is strategically designed to double in equipment size to accommodate future growth. There’s also a second facility on the campus, a four-story 103,500 square foot admin office building. Both buildings will seek LEED Silver certification.

“Locating one of just two national data centers in Charlotte emphasizes TWC’s commitment to the Charlotte area and a commitment to provide the latest and best technology to our customers,” said Carol Hevey, executive vice president of operations in a press release. TWC also announced the addition of 225 new jobs in the area, with all positions now filled, making Charlotte the company’s largest corporate campus.

<div id="ebStdBannerDiv_11161947_5914878756739199" dir="ltr">

Dubbed National Data Center East, the facility will deliver Time Warner Cable’s core residential and business products. Some key functions include hosting the applications that support approximately 70 million residential emails a day, billing records for more than 15 million customers, and all the back-end applications for the entire Time Warner Cable employee base. The building also uses some NaviSite cloud in it, specifically NaviSite’s NaviCloud Platform. NaviSite was <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/02/01/time-warner-buys-navisite-for-230-million/">acquired by Time Warner Cable</a> way back in February, 2011.

Here are some fun facts about the new data center:
<ul>
 	<li>Over 360,000 man hours were worked to construct the building and critical infrastructure, which is approximately the same number of spectator-hours as a sold out Ohio State Football game.  Their stadium holds over 102,000 people.</li>
 	<li>Mechanical plant consists of six 300 ton York Air-Cooled Chillers on Day 1.  At ultimate build there will be 14 of the 300 ton chillers, providing enough capacity to cool over 2,000 homes</li>
 	<li>The generator plant consists of four 500kw Generators with ultimate design of eight 2500 kW generators or enough power for over 10,000 homes.</li>
 	<li>One of the four generator assemblies weighs 253,000 pounds which is slightly less than its 256,000 pound foundation</li>
 	<li>There is the equivalent of 6,336,000 AA batteries on site.</li>
 	<li>There are 26,000 linear feet of precast concrete members, which if placed end to end would span roughly five miles</li>
 	<li>There are 20,023 linear feet of micropiles which equates to 655,000 pounds or the weight of twelve diesel engine generators</li>
 	<li>The chilled water system holds 87,279 gallons which is equal to ten large tanker trunks</li>
 	<li>There is 20,000 linear feet of caulking on the curtain wall system</li>
 	<li>There are roughly 2.5 miles of mechanical and plumbing piping which could span around the campus three times.</li>
 	<li>There were 12,900 yards of concrete poured for the project which equates to 50 miles of a 4’ sidewalk</li>
 	<li>There were 219,000 linear feet of conduit installed of which 132,000 feet is underground.</li>
 	<li>There were 1,316,000 linear feet of wiring</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from KALW Local Public Radio.</h6>
Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) has been praised for its modern architectural design, which takes into account the needs of post 9/11 travelers. For instance, T2 has comfortable Recompose Area where passengers can put back their shoes and belts after passing through security check. Most of the shops and restaurants are also located within the reach from the gates, so that passengers can easily see their flight status. But there is something else that makes Terminal 2 special: its art collection.

Above either side entrance to SFO’s Terminal 2 stretch huge artworks of hand-painted glass: bird wings to the left and airplane wings on the right. They are large, impressive, and, if you call a number posted next to the front door, they are explained.

“This artwork ‘Air Over Under’ plays with our experience of flight. Seattle-based artist Nori Sato said that once we leave our standard point of reference – the ground, it can be hard to figure out where we are,” says a recorded voice on the phone.

Then, the artist picks up where that narrator left off. “Depending on where we are in the air,” says Sato on the recording, “we can be above the clouds, below the clouds, in no clouds, in the middle of clouds, and the image was constructed with that in mind.”

Susan Pontious, director of the Civic Art Collection and Public Art Program for the city Arts Commission, runs the art program at the SFO in terms of the permanent acquisitions.

Inside the terminal, two objects hang from the ceiling on either side of the terminal entrance, right in the middle of the check-in area. Both look like they are made from different sized pieces of plastic.

“These two pieces are called “Topograph” and are inspired by topography of the Bay Area – and they also kind of remind me of clouds,” says Pontious.

The artist very carefully considered suspension mechanism as part of her aesthetic.

“They always remind me of these upside down rain clouds which is very appropriate on a day like today,” says Pontious.

Before the security gates is a small lounge where people can wait for arriving passengers. Most of the walls are covered by artwork from Marc Adams: big red tapestries with bright flowers that were inspired by the Bay Area gardens. It creates a cozy living room-like atmosphere.

“It is a technique and craft that you don't see that much anymore. I think this is one of the reasons they are valuable to us. And they are just flat out beautiful,” adds Pontious.

Near the lounge are a series of doors used by airport personnel to access the gates. We pass through into the Recompose Area, where people put their shoes and belts back on after the security check. The area is bright and airy, and home to an installation called “Every Beating Second”.

“The inspiration for the artist was that this is a place where you maybe took a little bit of a time to look around you and maybe notice some things.”

“Every Beating Second” consists of three nets hanging down from the ceiling. Each is a mixture of pink, purple and blue. Looking closer, I can see they're moving a little bit, as if they’re hovering in a breeze.

You may not think of an airport as a place to see art or take an audio tour to learn more about its paintings and sculptures. People mostly come here for one reason: to travel. But the City of San Francisco spent nearly two-and-a-half million dollars on artwork in Terminal 2. It's part of a city ordinance passed in 1969, which mandated that 2 percent of any construction costs be allocated to art enrichment or public art. As a result, SFO now has the most valuable public artwork collection in the city outside its fine art museums.

So next time, if you have some time to spend waiting for your flight, take a moment and look around. You can enjoy one of San Francisco's newest, most sophisticated, and expensive art galleries. It's arrived at Terminal 2.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from The Washington Post</h6>
The first test of the <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/" data-xslt="_http">National Zoo</a>’s new home for its sea lions was a few days ago. Summer dived in first, scoping out every nook and cranny without hesi­ta­tion. Next was the pup Sophie, who was a bit more cautious. The other two female sea lions went in last. By Day Three, they were acting as if they’d always lived there.

Now comes the bigger test, as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/modern-zoos-could-be-creating-a-new-kind-of-animal-wild-by-nature-shaped-by-captivity/2012/07/25/gJQAdq4IBX_story.html" data-xslt="_http">zoo</a> prepares to open its American Trail exhibit to the public Saturday.

The trail, planned and built over five years at a cost of $42 million, brings together several beloved North American species, including California sea lions, gray seals, gray wolves, ravens, pelicans, river otters, beavers and an American bald eagle. It is a combination not often seen at zoos. Many of the species have rebounded after their numbers dwindled, and zoo officials hope the exhibit will help convey a conservation message to their 2 million annual visitors.

The new exhibits are state-of-the-art and replace aging habitats that were cutting edge when they were built during the Carter administration but have since become increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain. Many of the improvements are not visible to visitors but are critical to the welfare of the animals. The sea lions enjoy better filtered water, which is kept clean using ozone instead of chlorine. The new pool doesn’t leak, like the old one did, and it conserves water by recycling it. The sea lions’ new digs also have a wave machine that sends water crashing against huge rocks. The oceanside feel is by design.

“We tried to create a little piece of the West Coast,” said Chuck Fillah, associate director of planning and strategic initiatives. “You might think you’re in Oregon.”

There are three viewing areas: one below water, one partially below water and one above water. Zoo officials hope these vantage points will better accommodate visitors, who sometimes find the newer, bigger, more naturalistic exhibits frustrating because animals can stray out of view.

“We have to balance conservation- science needs against visitor-experience needs against animal-welfare needs,” said Donald Moore, associate director of animal care sciences who is also a North American wildlife specialist and self-identified “bear man.”

The new habitat for the two gray wolves, for example, is up on a hill, offering visitors a clear view. However, in order to make the place more interesting for the inhabitants — or, in zoo lingo, to provide more “enrichment” — zoo officials installed cave-like huts based on wolf dens, a potential source of irritation for snapshot-happy tourists and crestfallen tots.

The humans who come to the zoo will be getting more enrichment, too.

Another major highlight of the American Trail, the Seal Rock Cafe, is purely for them. It will offer sustainable, locally sourced seafood dishes and is part of a larger overhaul by a new contractor, Sodexo, of the zoo’s previously hamburger-and-french-fry-heavy offering. The change was inspired in part by the success of the Mitsitam Cafe at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, which zoo officials said has raised expectations for visitors to all parts of the institution.

With federal funds shrinking, zoo officials need to find other ways to bring in revenue, said spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson, and improving amenities for visitors is potentially one of them.

None of the animals along the American Trail is as exotic as Kandula, one of the zoo’s Asian elephants, which strolled by the gray wolves along a fenced-in elephant walk.

“I never get tired of that,” Fillah said, pointing to Kandula.

But the animals are relevant to many of the zoo’s visitors, who are more likely to spot one of the animals while hiking or camping than they are to see an elephant or a giant panda.

“Families come to Washington maybe only once in their lives to see their nation’s capital,” Moore said.

“We want them to see iconic wildlife from around North America.”

<strong>WASHINGTON (CBSDC) -</strong>The National Zoo is debuting a new exhibit in September aimed at bringing visitors into the habitat of the North American wildlife.

California sea lions and seals are the stars of the new American Trail Exhibit which will also feature wolves, otters, beavers and plenty more wildlife. Guests can wander through landscaped trails where they’ll have the chance to come face-to-face with sea lions.

The American Trail highlights species indigenous to North American wildlife that represent the “triumph of the American spirit and conservation success stories” as explained by the National Zoo. Many of the species of the exhibit have been listed as endangered at some point or another and have recovered through the help of persistent conservation efforts.

The American trail is lined with poplars and evergreens and the rolling sound of falling water. A kid-friendly tide pool is also on hand for young children to splash and play. But perhaps the coolest feature of the new exhibit, set to debut September 1, is the underwater sea cave, where patrons can enjoy the view of life below the water’s surface.

<h3>SEATTLE: TRACE AT THE W HOTEL</h3>
After a swanky new makeover, the W Seattle’s ground floor restaurant reopened in March as Trace. Honolulu native Steven Ariel, who previously worked in the kitchens of local favorites Canlis and Café Juanita, creates an expansive pan-Asian menu that ranges from nigiri sushi to espresso-crusted wagyu flatiron steak. The beverage program favors Pacific Northwest distilleries, Seattle microbrews and sakes from Japan. <em><a title="Best Hotel Restaurants: Trace at the W Hotel" href="http://www.traceseattle.com/" target="_blank">traceseattle.com</a></em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from Calvary Comments</h6>
On Sunday, Calvary officially cut the ribbon to open our new, state-of-the-art facility on Good Hope Road in Anacostia. As you may know, Calvary began this expansion project back in 2010 as a response to the growing crisis of homelessness in DC. In our new home, Calvary will grow to serve even more women every year and expand the range of support services they offer to homeless women.

As winter temperatures in DC continue to plummet, the opening of our new home also means that even more women will be offered a safe, warm home before the coldest days of winter hit, and just in time for the holidays.

Executive Director Kristine Thompson, Addiction Recovery Group Leader Beverly Sellers-Robinson, Board President Tracy Ballard, Campaign Chair Cindy Schwarz, and Deputy Director of Operations at The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness Cornell Chappelle all spoke at the ceremony. After the remarks, all of the speakers cut the ribbon together to officially welcome women into our new home. The ribbon-cutting also marked the official opening of the Life Skills, Education, and Arts Center, the new Wellness Center, and the Good Hope Kitchen.

Over 120 donors, volunteers, and other supporters of Calvary’s expansion project attended Sunday’s celebration. Guests enjoyed tours of the new building and light refreshments. To the supporters who were able to join us on Sunday – thank you for celebrating with us. For the friends who were unable to make it, we hope you will come visit us soon at Good Hope Road!

Mark G. Anderson Consultants is a project management company that supports corporations and institutions to meet the complex organizational objectives through their design, construction, facility, and procurement projects. In 2012, they were named one of the best places to work by the Washington Business Journal.

OTJ was chosen to create a model floor plan which would have an updated look for the company. The office was to have a modern aesthetic with clean, sleek finishes. The design incorporates bright red and white, which are the company's colors. The idea was to create a new, standardized floor plan for the office, which would then be incorporated into all of MGAC's occupied floors.

MGAC's old office plan had a private office layout, with each employee having their own closed office. Moving to a mostly open floor plan enables more collaboration and easier communication. Bright natural lighting also increases productivity and makes the space feel more inviting, fresh, and open.

More collaboration is made possible by benching, glass front offices, and a pantry and copy room which face out into the open area. This new, open system creates a comfortable work space that is more efficient than a private, closed plan. It also allows the accommodation of new technology, and the flexibility to change and grow as MGAC does.

OTJ worked closely with MGAC to meet their design needs.

In the end, OTJ helped MGAC to make a smooth transition into a beautiful and efficient open office design that will continue to adapt and meet the company's needs for years to come.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from CUE Magazine</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

$874 million Hiway Federal Credit Union (<em>www.hiway.org</em>) in St. Paul, Minn., followed a useful map and took many of the right steps, but lacked an ideal guide. Hiway FCU did a request for proposal and considered four presentations before choosing an Atlanta-based general contractor that worked with a Denver-based architectural firm to build the CU’s 43,000-square-foot, $12 million administrative building in 2005. Both firms were highly recommended; both specialized in financial institution buildings. In hindsight, the results were good but not great, says Jeff Schwalen, president/CEO.

“We got a good quality building, but we overspent,” he now concludes. For instance, the building has a computer-controlled lighting system that theoretically saves energy and makes Hiway FCU fashionably green.

“They sold us on the concept, but it turns out to be more trouble than it’s worth,” he explains. “We have to get someone from the manufacturer to adjust it. People turn out the lights when they leave anyway.”

Or take landscaping. “We have over 100 shrubs we don’t really need,” Schwalen says. And the glazed specialty brick exterior looks classy, but added unnecessary cost, he reflects.

“We could have had a satisfactory building of the same size for three-quarters of what we spent. The architect and contractor pitched quality and led us down that path. It’s easy to get wrapped up in a new building and spend more than you should.”

He now has second thoughts about bypassing local planners and builders. The shrubs may still look nice, but not the trees. “They didn’t understand our arctic weather,” Schwalen says of his designers. “They built four huge above-ground planters in front of the building and planted trees there. They all died in the first winter.”

Interestingly, Hiway FCU is the credit union for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, so Schwalen has a board loaded with civil engineers. It might sound like he could call on these construction-savvy directors for guidance, but building a CU administration center is a lot different than building a road or a bridge, he points out. “They work on huge projects with huge budgets. They monitored our progress and kept us within boundaries, but they didn’t delve into the specifics,” he explains.

Knowledge about CU building projects is something you can acquire, as Schwalen is doing, or it’s something you can buy. Give CUES member Lynette W. Smith, president/CEO of $87 million Washington Gas Light Federal Credit Union (<em>www.wglfcu.org</em>) in Springfield, Va., a construction project and she’ll reach for the phone.

Her first call would be to Walt Layton, vice president of Mark G. Anderson Consultants (<em>www.mgac.com</em>), Washington, D.C., to engage MGAC to be the construction manager/ owner’s representative—to plan and oversee the project from beginning to end. Her second call would be to Clint Brackman, principal at Architecture Inc. (<em>www.archinc.com</em>), Reston, Va., to ask him to work with Layton as the designer and architect.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC</strong> – Mark G. Anderson Consultants ("MGAC") recently completed project management services in the renovation of the W Seattle's 5,500 square foot ground-floor commons area and restaurant, which created an exciting new "living room" and dining space for guests. As a lifestyle brand, the W prides itself on the quality and comfort it provides its clients, and this just-finished expanse more than meets their standard.

The new 80-seat restaurant, TRACE, and the 10-seat sushi bar merge seamlessly into the organic flow, while the open floor plan allows guests easy access and plenty of space in which to unwind. A sleek, stainless-steel-clad fireplace anchors the living room, and the repositioned bar glimmers with a Sensitile acrylic countertop featuring embedded lights. Specialty subcontractors and vendors were called in to execute the multiple unique finishes and details. The overall effect is bold and inviting.

Construction was accomplished over a 12-week period, and all efforts took place while the hotel remained fully operational.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What does the new normal look like? I have lived through multiple financial crises and recessions. The early 80s featured double digit interest rates and high unemployment after decades of inflation (anyone care to assume my first home mortgage? 12-7/8 %?) Eight to ten years later we saw the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/s&amp;l/">S&amp;L crisis</a>.  S&amp;Ls (for those of you in the younger generation) stands for Savings and Loans, some odd sort of non-bank bank that existed long ago but is now largely extinct. The S&amp;Ls cratered, leaving many Americans high and dry, without their deposits, due to over indulgence in commercial real estate. The government spent tens of billions of dollars to “fix” that crisis. That led us to “it’s the economy stupid,” and eight years of Bill Clinton as the internet bubble inflated. The bubble popped, and the country went back into recession. 9/11 and the government spent billions of dollars to fix that problem, which led to a comparatively affluent six years, until the latest real estate bubble burst, taking banks and housing with it in 2007 and 2008. The government then proceeded to … well you get the picture. Thirty years plus of a boom and bust cycle of excess, bubbles inflated, crisis ensues, financial institutions get taken apart, and the government spends a whole lot of money “fixing” the problem.

So what does that mean to those of us who make our living working on capital projects that involve large amounts of money, as well as large commitments of time and risk? Throughout these past 30 years real estate and construction have fared comparatively well. Somewhere someone is always growing, shrinking, or needing an update of outmoded infrastructure. The 80s saw a huge boon in commercial construction, the 90s saw the internet and technology companies requiring data centers and roofs over their foosball tables, the 2000s saw security concerns and government contracting grow. The advent of desktop PC use in the mid-80s drove higher electrical use, and changing office space requirements. <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/1990s/ada.html">ADA</a>, from the late 80s and early 90s, drove a large change in the built environment. Foosball tables and garage doors dominated the late 90s until 9/11. Post 9/11, biometric scanners and security were influences in the built world. But where are we now?

<a href="http://enr.construction.com/economics/">Construction costs</a> have escalated to the point that “trophy properties” seem out of reach for government users, even should those that have the political and financial capital to contemplate new facilities. While our corporate clients are truly global now, their allocation of real estate to each function has drastically reduced. Consequently, vacancy rates have climbed, as the appetite for new space has diminished due to “smaller portions” being the meal of the day. But the mobile world means broadband traffic, personal travel, and business at the speed of technology. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/practices/critical-environments">Critical environments</a> (data centers) are needed more than ever, as are hospitality projects to accommodate a highly mobile world. The <a href="https://www.mgac.com/practices/government">public sector</a> is looking for better, faster, cheaper, and that results in updating obsolescent spaces to reduce energy, space per staff member, and provide greater flexibility for organizational change. Higher vacancy, more focus on cost, and a driven, results oriented decision making process are the new normal. We see it across our business practices. The good news, at least for MGAC, is that global reach, extreme accountability for successful outcomes, and nimbleness are benchmarks to succeed. Can’t wait for what’s next.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC was recently recognized by a local business newspaper as one of Washington, DC’s <em><strong>Best Places to Work</strong></em> – the fifth time we’ve managed to garner that honor. For anyone who builds and maintains a business roof
over the heads of a staff, <em><strong>Best Places</strong></em> feels affirmative:  something you are doing is working out. Benefits, retirement savings, and a company gym have become expectations. To my way of thinking, the criteria that results in a
<strong><em>Best Places to Work</em></strong> award is more closely linked to each individual’s autonomy and self-direction.<img class="size-full wp-image-155 alignright" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wbj-bptw-logo-2013-rsm.jpg" alt="wbj-bptw-logo-2013---rsm" width="120" height="170" />

Whenever someone new joins our firm, I take the opportunity to share my view on the difference between stress and pressure. How it’s possible to hold a high-responsibility role and feel “pressure” from the burden of responsibility and decisions without feeling “stressed,” while it’s equally possible to experience genuine stress without having a high level of responsibility (think manual laborer,worrying about paying the rent). The difference boils down to autonomy and self-direction. Everything in my experience and reading indicates that people thrive in an environment that provides them with this freedom; that self-direction and autonomy trump virtually every other attribute in the workplace. That feeling of “I can make a decision and set my own direction” is so much better than “I am doing it the way it always gets done.” With the former mindset, you get creativity and enthusiasm, while the latter often results in boredom and complacency.

Hopefully, MGAC successfully translates autonomy and entrepreneurialism into its culture, and the resultant outcome is “<strong><em>Best Places to Work</em></strong>.” We are not for everyone. People do get discouraged because frankly our environment can be more demanding than just doing what the manual dictates. With greater freedom comes greater responsibility and risk. But it is so much more fun that way.]]></content:encoded>

In a brief outdoor gathering Monday in a field at Glenstone, the Raleses outlined their expansion plans and said they hope to make what is considered one of the most extraordinary modern art collections in private hands more accessible to the public.

Their collection, which includes works by Alexander Calder, Henri Matisse and Mark Rothko, is now <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/peter-fischli-and-david-weiss-exhibition-displays-a-fine-light-smart-touch/2013/05/16/24541638-b9a5-11e2-92f3-f291801936b8_story.html" data-xslt="_http">exhibited on a rotating basis</a> in a 25,000-square-foot building designed by well-known modernist architect Charles Gwathmey. Glenstone’s admission is free, but the collection is open only a few hours on a few days a week. Visits are restricted to small groups, which are shown around by docents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Architecture Magazine</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: John Gendall</h6>
Breaking ground this June, the new pavilions formed from dry-stacked concrete blocks will house new gallery space and foundation offices for the private museum in Potomac, Md.

When a client’s descriptor includes “billionaire,” just about anything is possible, but it can often tend toward the garish (see: Trump) or the hyper-controlled (see: Broad). So, when Mitchell P. Rales, a manufacturing and technology magnate, and his wife, Emily Wei Rales, who are, yes, billionaires, set out to expand Glenstone, a not-for-profit organization they co-founded in 2006 in Potomac, Md., to collect and exhibit contemporary art, they took a striking approach: slow, steady, and site-specific.

Back in 2010, the husband-and-wife team hired New York’s Thomas Phifer and Partners to design what would become an additional 150,000 gross square feet (including 50,000 square feet of new gallery space) on a bucolic 200-acre site. Charles Gwathmey had designed the original 2006 structure.

The nearly three-year design process was remarkable for its deliberativeness. “For six months,” says partner Thomas Phifer, FAIA, “it was just the three of us working out ideas.” Due to the contemporary nature of the collection, the architects were also able to work directly with some of the artists themselves. “We spent an enormous amount of time looking at art museums in Europe, paying close attention to light and material,” he adds. But in June, builders will finally break ground (anticipating a 2016 opening).

In the end, Phifer’s team settled on discrete concrete pavilions that pinwheel around a central, sunken plaza, designed by Berkeley, Calif.-based PWP Landscape Architecture. Rather than using large concrete panels, Phifer designed concrete blocks—about 20,000 in all—each 6 feet long by 1 foot tall and 1 foot wide to be dry-stacked on site to form the load-bearing walls. “We think concrete is very beautiful,” he says. The pavilions are each daylit through roof apertures following extensive lighting studies—digital and analog models, supplemented with site-based studies. Each is tailored for particular artists. “The light works differently with a Brice Marden painting versus a Cy Twombly sculpture,” Phifer explains. “If we don’t get the lighting right,” he adds, “for me, the whole building just falls apart.”

The design team was determined to capitalize on Glenstone’s unique context. To accomplish this, he situated guest services and amenities—parking, admissions, gift shop, café and administrative offices—away from the art itself. After parking, for example, arriving guests take an approximately 8-minute walk through the landscape to arrive at the art. “It’s all very silent,” Phifer says. “We wanted to remove any distractions.”

<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Rebecca Cooper</h6>
The owners of the private art museum at Glenstone in Potomac, Md., plan to build a second museum on the property that will dwarf the existing 25,000 square foot gallery space, the New York Times reported.

Glenstone founders Mitchell and Emily Rales plan to spend $125 million on the addition, which will be complete in 2016, the Times reported. Mitchell Rales co-founded Danaher Corp. (NYSE:DHR), the D.C.-based science and technology firm, with his brother in 1984. Both men still serve on the board.

The museum will be far more accessible to the public, with a large entrance pavilion welcoming guests to the property and visiting hours five days per week, instead of the three days per week its currently open.

(Those wishing to view the galleries will still need to make a reservation, however, in order to ensure that the museum doesn't get too crowded, the Rales told the Times.)

The museum will also continue to be free, making it one of the largest private museums to remain free of charge in the Washington Region. The Phillips Collection, Corcoran Gallery, O Street Museum, Kreeger Museum and National Building Museum all now charge admission fees.

Glenstone is located on a 127-acre tract of land in Potomac. In January, the property's owners foreshadowed the museum's expansion when they applied to hook up to the Montgomery County sewer system. Glenstone received that approval, but it was not without the opposition of some Montgomery County residents, who argued that the Rales' property lies on land that was meant to stay undeveloped.

The museum will also need to go through the rest of the county's regulatory process, including for building permits and other approvals.

<h6>By: Carol Vogel</h6>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="700" data-total-count="700">Potomac, Md. — Tucked behind a winding road dotted with McMansions are 200 acres of bucolic walking paths and woodlands. There are sculptures too, by artists like Ellsworth Kelly, Richard Serra and Jeff Koons along with a man-made pond and, nestled beside it, a Modernist limestone building that houses a small contemporary art museum. This is <a title="museum site" href="http://glenstone.org/">Glenstone</a>, the creation of Mitchell P. Rales, 56, the intensely private Washington industrialist and his wife, Emily, 36. Although it is only some 15 miles from downtown Washington, in the seven years it’s been open — three days a week, by appointment only — no more than 10,000 people have visited their eye-popping collection of contemporary art.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="1014">That figure is expected to multiply by a factor of 10. Plans are in the works for a major expansion that is said to be costing the couple upward of $125 million. Once it is completed in 2016, this enclave will become a more public place in which to see art and learn about architecture as well as the environment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="528" data-total-count="1542">A three-minute stroll from the sleek 25,000-square-foot museum by Charles Gwathmey, the New York architect who died in 2009, will be a second museum, five times as big — the rough equivalent of the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. Designed by <a title="The architect’s Web site" href="http://www.thomasphifer.com/">Tom Phifer</a>, another New York architect, it will feature a series of interconnecting pavilions for permanent installations, each devoted to a single artist, as well as a large gallery for special exhibitions. (The original museum building will also hold rotating shows.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="1898">Plans also call for a new entrance similar to that of a national park, with a Japanese cedar entrance pavilion. Peter Walker, a Berkeley-based landscape architect, is planting more than 5,000 trees from 40 native species and creating a sustainable meadow along with a flowering water garden. “We’re out to create something different,” Mr. Rales said.</p>

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[This is Glenstone, the creation of Mitchell P. Rales, 56, the intensely private Washington industrialist and his wife, Emily, 36. Although it is only some 15 miles from downtown Washington, in the seven years it’s been open — three days a week, by appointment only — no more than 10,000 people have visited their eye-popping collection of contemporary art. That figure is expected to multiply by a factor of 10. Plans are in the works for a major expansion that is said to be costing the couple upward of $125 million. Once it is completed in 2016, this enclave will become a more public place in which to see art and learn about architecture as well as the environment.]]></excerpt:encoded>

<strong>MIDDLEBURG, VIRGINIA</strong> is an unlikely power hub. But when Sheila Johnson established a base of operations there on a 200-acre horse farm, she created an entire industry fueled by her own pursuits—in a countryside best known for fox hunts.
<div>
<div>

As cofounder of BET (launched in 1980 with her then-husband, Robert; they divorced in 2002 after selling the first African-American cable network to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=VIAB">Viacom</a>  for $3 billion), Johnson helped shape its programming, producing an Emmy-winning show that targeted teens with motivational messages. "We saw an opportunity to give African-Americans a voice," she says. Today, her portfolio encompasses sports organizations (she is the only African-American woman to hold a stake in three professional teams: the NBA Wizards, WNBA Mystics and NHL Capitals); luxury resorts owned by Salamander Hotels &amp; Resorts, including the top-ranked Innisbrook Golf Resort and Spa near Tampa; private jets (ProJet Aviation); and a line of scarves.

</div>
</div>
Although she's always supported women's athletics, her investment in sports was meant to create exposure for the Salamander brand, which she takes canny measures to promote. An airport in Leesburg, Virginia—housing ProJet planes for charter—conveniently allows jet-setting guests access to the Salamander Resort &amp; Spa, opening this August. And as a longtime movie lover—she produced <em>Kicking It,</em> a documentary about the Homeless World Cup soccer game, as well as this fall's feature <em>The Butler,</em> a star-studded historical drama set in the White House—Johnson will host the first Middleburg Film Festival in October, another draw for visitors.

When Johnson—a no-nonsense, 5-foot-1 mother of two adult children, remarried to the circuit court judge who presided over her divorce—recently took up golf, she discovered that most private courses were closed to her. So she bought one, and became a member of the U.S. Golf Association's executive committee. Now Innisbrook is the only top-ranked course in the country with an African-American pro. "I never had access to golf until I owned a resort," she says. "You have to diversify to grow. I'm not afraid to take risks and fail."

Sheila Johnson's husband is a circuit court judge. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he is a federal judge.

<h6>By Geraldine Fabrikant</h6>
<h6>6/5/2013</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

Three years ago when visitors arrived at the Ritz-Carlton in Sarasota, Florida, they found a formal dining room and a wood-paneled bar glowing in soft lighting, more the style of an English men¹s club than a resort hotel.

But the hotel group had been rethinking its approach to design, and decided that interiors should reflect their locations.

Today, those same areas are called Jack Dusty, a seafood restaurant, lounge and marketplace presented in a color scheme of beiges punctuated with accent colors. The once dark and somber bar now has chairs of pale beech wood and a marble counter that is nearly white.

"We want our hotels to reflect a more local experience of the place," said Herve Humler, president of Ritz-Carlton, which has 82 hotels in 27 countries. "Our customers want a more authentic experience. At our hotel in Morocco, for example, we are using mosaic floors and local carved-wood artwork."

Ritz-Carlton has been pursuing a popular trend in high-end hotel design: offering a luxurious experience, but a local luxe.

The effort has been to "blow the dust off the lion and the crown," as Bill Barrie, Ritz-Carlton¹s senior vice president of design and project management, put it, referring to the company logo. The hotels, once known for their dark-wood ambience, "had kind of gotten stuck in time," he said.

At a new hotel being built on the Indonesian island of Bali, the company is using slate instead of marble for a more natural look. And bathrooms at the Ritz-Carlton Shanghai, Pudong, which opened in 2010, were done in the Art Deco style that was all the rage there in the 1930s.

While some top-end hotels are injecting a more casual feel into their elegant surroundings, others are modernizing while keeping the glamour of well-known names. An example is Starwood¹s costly renovations of the Gritti Palace in Venice and the Alfonso XIII in Seville, Spain, two of the hotels in its Luxury Collection group.

A visual sonic boom greets guests in the lobby of Seattle's W Hotel. Space seemingly explodes outward from a four-story-tall cylindrical fireplace that's clad in stainless steel tiles set in a radiating pattern to create the illusion on movement and expansion. Banquettes fan our form the fireplace emphasizing this expanding wave of energy. Overhead, the window of the DJ booth looms like a jet cockpit. It's one of several references to the region's role in aviation history as Boeing's home base.

This was an early W built in 1999, and Skylab Architecture's charge in a recent interior renovation of the lobby and public areas was to bring a fresh vision that captures the city's unique identity. "It was challenging because Seattle has such an eclectic and rich culture," says Brent Grubb, principal at Skylab who led the design project with Jeff Kovel, a principal and founder of the Portland-based firm. Rather than narrowing down references, the designers embraced them all: the aviation industry, native culture, timber lodges, and the music scene.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>The Washington Post</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Sarah Halzack</h6>
Company: MGAC

Location: Washington

Employees: 96 locally; 106 worldwide.

It was a seemingly impossible tie-breaker question in a hard-fought trivia game: What is the square footage of the Pentagon?

A team made up of staffers from project management firm MGAC wasn’t confident they’d be able to come up with the best estimate. But they soon realized they had a serious leg up on their opponents, because one co-worker had previously worked in the behemoth building’s facilities division and knew the obscure number almost precisely.

With that bit of minutia, he won a round of free beer for his colleagues.

Pub trivia nights have become a regular ritual for employees at the Washington-based consultancy. They often gather as a team at Elephant &amp; Castle, a bar on 19th St. NW, to face off against other trivia enthusiasts.

Their best prize so far, staffers said, was tickets to a Washington Nationals game.

The players are a mix of trivia buffs and relative novices, but MGAC staffers say everyone gets into the competitive spirit. It’s an experience that has helped build camaraderie among the group.

“In between rounds, it’s not like we’re all just staring into our drinks,” said Mark Ryan, an MGAC economist. “There’s lots of conversation going on.”

Though it has become one of the firm’s key team-building activities, it was not originated in the human resources department.

“It just came together,” Ryan said. “It was not an organized, top-down kind of thing.”

But Mollie O’Donnell, the firm’s human resources director, said these self-directed initiatives fit comfortably into the workplace culture MGAC aims to create.

“We’re very entrepreneurial. It’s actually one of our fundamentals,” O’Donnell said.

Kate McLaine, MGAC’s office manager, said that attitude helps cement staffers’ commitment to the firm.

“I think they’re really great about supporting small group activities like this, McLaine said. “And I think it pays dividends for them in a workforce that stays engaged.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently traveled to the West Coast where much is being made of paying a living wage, economic concessions to bring business, and a unionized workforce potentially burning a bridge for a multi-decade body of work and backlog. Similarly, every economic pressure we have faced in 2013 has been a downward push on expenses, reducing cost, and increasing efficiency. Lastly, I just saw mention of a food bank occurring within a large national employer, to solely benefit internal employees of that firm, with the clear and implicit understanding that the employees did not make enough money to support their families in a food secure environment.

MGAC was recently honored by <em>The Washingtonian </em>magazine as one of its top 50 “Great Places to Work.” Foosball tables, gyms, and dogs roaming the office a great employer do not make. At MGAC we work to balance the economic imperatives of running a business with the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like to be treated. That includes our team members. We recently lost a body of work to two competitors, both of whom use "contract employees" on a project-by-project basis. I see that, as with most of my above observations, as symptomatic of a "race to the bottom.”

A race to the bottom places no premium on quality of service, dedication to meeting goals, improvement through the collective wisdom of an organization, or communal responsibility to get it right, do it better, and build something lasting. A race to the bottom is about the here, the now, and the short term "fix,” that in reality is no fix at all. Being recognized as one of <em>The</em> <em>Washingtonian’s</em> “Great Places to Work” provides a moment to reflect on what is important, what matters, and the path forward. Despite the prevalence of a race to the bottom that surrounds us, we will continue to practice our Fundamentals, live our values, and work to make tomorrow better than yesterday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was over six years ago that I received a call from Sister Mary Popit, the Executive Director of <a href="http://www.nebw.org/">New Endeavors by Women (NEW)</a>. She asked if I would be willing to meet a woman named Allyson who was about to graduate from NEW’s program and looking for a job.<img class="size-full wp-image-148 alignright" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-logo.jpg" alt="new-logo" width="200" height="200" />

As I learned, it isn’t possible to say no to a nun. It seemed like only minutes later that Allyson and I met over a cup of coffee at Starbucks. I learned that before Allyson had fallen into addiction and homelessness she handled accounting for her own firm. She had even driven a dump truck for the construction contractor for the Washington Convention Center.

I forwarded Allyson’s resume to two DC firms, one of which hired her on the spot. She went on to work for this firm for six years.

Allyson was honored last week by NEW at their 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary event and received the NEW LIGHT Alumna Award, presented to “an alumna whose commitment to reaching back to help others succeed makes her a ray of light and an inspiration.”

During Allyson’s speech she talked about how she reconnected with her family after graduating from the NEW program. Her very proud daughter was in attendance. Allyson noted that for the past six years she has lived in a market rate apartment and has paid her rent on time every month. She is now working full time and going to school at night and hopes to graduate with an accounting degree soon. She dreams that she might one day have a house with a yard for her grandson to play in.

I am so very proud of Allyson and all that NEW does to help women move out of homelessness. Allyson is a shining example of their success and one of over 3,000 women that NEW has helped over the past 25 years.

A true success story of what it means to pay it forward.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During my over 30 years in Construction and Project Management, I’ve had my share of memorable moments on the jobsite, almost all of them tinged with humor. One of the funniest, politically incorrect lines I’ve heard was delivered by a millworker: “So if you’re in construction, what’s your husband, a nurse?”

Even rats can be funny, particularly if you’re lucky enough to get some help from above. During the construction of a museum, a local hawk regularly visited the site to feast on the resident rats. I was pleased to advise the client and board of directors that the hungry hawk was single handedly saving us money on pest control. He missed at least one though. When I toured Lt. General Claudia Kennedy, the first female three-star Army general through the site, a wayward rat scampered across our path. I didn’t flinch, and neither did the general.

I admit I did flinch a bit during this next one. The early demolition phase of a Washington landmark building took place during the holidays. In keeping with a longstanding tradition, the building developer allowed the City to put holiday decorations in the windows. All was well until the demo contractor cut out some piping on the second floor, causing sparks to land right onto Santa and his reindeer, torching the entire display! Luckily the construction crew was quick to get a very charred Santa, Rudolph and his fellow reindeer into the dumpster and out of view before traumatizing any children.

The tales get even better when you spearhead a move. The first phase of a law firm’s move took place on a very stormy night, with the moving trucks arriving just as the sky erupted. I entered the server room and discovered subcontractors had drilled a hole in the roof for a future A/C unit and had forgotten to plug it. Water was now gushing into the active, online server room. In torrential rain and driving wind, I went up on the roof to locate the hole. Channeling MacGyver, I gathered scraps of insulation and wood to plug the hole, preventing the impending flood.  Wet, mad and looking a bit like Phyllis Diller, it was not one of my better moments, but it was definitely funny.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from Richmond Times-Dispatch</h6>
<h6>By: John Reid Blackwell</h6>
<h6>3/13/2014</h6>
The Richmond area is now home to another big data center, this one operated in Chesterfield County by credit card company Capital One Financial Corp.

Capital One, the Richmond region’s largest private employer, completed work in October on the $150 million data center in Chesterfield’s Meadowville Technology Park off Interstate 295.
<div class="encrypted-content">

Operations had already started there. But on Wednesday, the McLean-based company held a ceremony to serve as symbolic opening for the center, located in a highly secured facility surrounded by a wooded area and tall, reinforced fencing.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

The security is important because the Meadowville site is one of Capital One’s three primary data centers where the company stores and manages vast amounts of information produced by its business providing financial services to roughly 65 million customers.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“This is a big deal for Virginia,” Gov. Terry McAuliffe said at the ceremony.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“When you think about Capital One, you think about Virginia; you think about 15,000 employees — the eighth-largest employer in Virginia,” said McAuliffe, who ceremoniously opened the center by connecting faux computer cables along with Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s founder, chairman and CEO, who is a close friend of McAuliffe’s.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

Fairbank called the opening “a symbolic indication of where Capital One is and where we are going.”

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

He said the company was founded in the Richmond area more than 20 years ago on the idea that financial services would be revolutionized by technology and digital information.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“Our view was, if that is really where banking is going, why not just start out by going there and building a company that is a fusion of an information company and a bank? And that is what we did,” he said.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“If you think about it now — all those trends are just accelerating,” he said.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“The world, which in many ways has been transformed already by information, is in many ways poised to be transformed by the revolution in big data,” he said.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

Capital One is consolidating operations at its eight data centers that it has been operating because of numerous recent acquisitions of other banks and credit card providers.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

The data operations are being consolidated into three centers — the one in Chesterfield, one in Henrico County, and one near Chicago.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“That takes out risk and complexity, increases efficiency and reduces cost for us,” said Brian Cobb, the company’s managing vice president for information technology operations.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

The data center currently uses about 111,000 square feet within the 242,000-square-foot building. Capital One expects to triple the size of the data center over time.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

The center has about 50 employees now, but the company expects it will employ more than 100 eventually.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

“These are typically IT professionals who do things like data networking,” Cobb said. “These are people who have STEM degrees,” or training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

</div>
<div class="encrypted-content">

The Richmond region is home to other data centers, including the Quality Technology Services center in the former Qimonda computer chip factory in eastern Henrico and the Peak 10 Inc. center in northern Henrico.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Washingtonian</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Lydia Strohl</h6>
<h6>8/26/2013</h6>
When the veil is lifted on August 29, Salamander Resort &amp; Spa will have been in the planning more than ten years—plenty of time for Sheila Johnson to slip in lots of luxury touches.

The resort sits just outside Middleburg on 340 acres. The 168-room, 250,000-square-foot hotel is built to evoke a country estate, with a pale plaster facade, a stone courtyard, terraces, and wrought-iron balconies. One wing houses corporate meeting rooms and a 5,000-square-foot ballroom.

“It’s elegant but not formal,” says Prem Devadas, president of Salamander Hotels &amp; Resorts, who hopes the spaces become a hub not just for guests but for locals. “We wanted it to look like an old building that’s been around for a long time. No shiny finishes.”

Newly distressed wood beams line corridors, and classical millwork accentuates ceilings. Metal and glass lighting was inspired by carriage lamps. Large windows bring the outside in. Horse and walking trails wind through the property, and there’s a family pool and snack bar, an equestrian center with a riding ring, a scenic pond, a putting green, and a treetop canopy tour.

The large foyer gives way to a grand living room, with fireplaces on both sides and groupings of lounge-friendly furniture that aim to keep things cozy despite 21-foot ceilings. French doors open to a terrace overlooking the 100,000-square-foot grand lawn, where guests can play bocce and croquet. Next to the living room is a wood-paneled library housing 2,000 volumes purchased when the town library underwent renovation, plus a wine bar with a billiard room, where local winemakers are anticipated for afternoon tastings.

The main restaurant, Harrimans, has a terrace overlooking a garden where guests can pick their own ingredients with the chef. An adjacent private dining room, designed like a tack room, will be lined with equestrian trophies won by Johnson’s daughter and other local riders.

The kitchen’s design was overseen by culinary director and chef Todd Gray, owner of downtown DC’s Equinox, and features a classroom for cooking lessons and corporate events. A native of the area—he’s from nearby Fredericksburg—Gray is focusing on ingredients from the Tidewater region, which spans from Virginia to North Carolina. Johnson’s relatively recent switch to veganism also informs the offerings; she and Gray have been consulting with a raw-food/vegan chef. A sneak peak at the menu reveals locally harvested treats such as blue crab, Rappahannock River oysters, Angus beef from the Plains, and Berkshire pork from Pennsylvania. In-season, local vegetables will star on every plate, many grown in the kitchen gardens or at Johnson’s nearby farm.

In the opposite wing from the restaurant, a walkway lined with waterfalls leads to a 23,000-square-foot spa boasting 14 treatment rooms, some with private outdoor areas and fireplaces, as well as a fitness center and indoor pool. Guests can rent cabanas at the private spa pool. The spa also has a <em>rasul,</em> a domed, tiled steam room where couples apply mud to each other; after 40 minutes in hydrating steam, cleansing waters jet from the ceiling.

Guest rooms feature traditional decor, with photographs taken by Johnson, 300-thread-count linens, and marble bathrooms. Some rooms have fireplaces, all have terraces or balconies, and some of the ground-floor rooms are dog-friendly.

Rates will start at $425 a night in peak season (April through June, September and October), $275 for non-peak, with packages and group pricing available.

Johnson is also planning events on the property, such as this fall’s Middleburg Film Festival, which she spearheaded; among other movies, she hopes to screen <em>Lee Daniels’ The Butler,</em> a feature she executive-produced. The Windy Hill Fashion Show, a popular annual fundraiser previously held on her farm, will move to the resort.

Next year, Salamander hopes to break ground for 49 luxury homes on 60 acres of the resort bordering the village, with a pedestrian walkway to town. The homes, which Devadas anticipates will start at $2 million, will have groundskeeping, housekeeping, laundry and room service, access to the spa and fitness facilities, and restaurant discounts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Source from Washingtonian</h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Carol Ross Joynt</h6>
<h6>8/29/2013</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

There’s clearly a mutual admiration society between businesswoman Sheila Johnson<strong> </strong>and political commentator David Gergen. He was just one of many who came to praise her Thursday at the grand opening of her new <a href="http://www.salamanderresort.com/" target="blank">Salamander Resort &amp; Spa</a> in Middleburg, Virginia. The dozens of invited guests, who sat in white chairs under the front portico and in the driveway of the resort, gave her two standing ovations. Gergen invoked the anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech. “Isn’t it fitting that this week, 50 years later, we come to celebrate Sheila’s dream? She will tell you it takes perseverance and courage . . . and she has plenty of both.”

When fans weren’t praising Johnson’s resort project, they praised her filmmaking moxie — including her latest endeavor, <em>Lee Daniels’ The Butler</em>. Gergen said he was at the Boston premiere with Johnson. “She brought that to the screen. She raised the money to make it possible.”

Making the 185-room, 340-acre resort possible took a number of years, was stopped by but survived the Great Recession, and caused some kerfuffle among the area’s landed gentry, especially since the land Johnson bought and developed once belonged to a pair of them, politician and diplomat W. Averell Harriman and his socialite and diplomat wife, Pamela Harriman. Both are deceased. “Somewhere up there, Pamela Harriman is smiling because of what Sheila has built with Salamander,” Gergen said. “I will guarantee you the stars and diamonds will be showered on this resort.”

Gergen’s words were a reference not to heaven or Tiffany’s, but to the notable travel guides that use stars and diamonds as a ratings system. A representative of Forbes Travel Guide, for example, was among the guests, and was acknowledged by Prem Devadas, the president of Salamander Hospitality. When Devadas came to work for Johnson he brought with him from Charleston, South Carolina, his family and a history of helping to score those coveted stars and diamonds for his previous resort employers. He seems not to have looked back. Salamander “is the very best resort I have ever worked in,” Devadas said. “We’re happy, and it’s all because of Sheila.”

Praise for Johnson also came from representatives of the town of Middleburg, Loudoun County, and the state of Virginia. Rita McClenny, president and CEO of the Virginia Tourism Corporation, said, “I can’t imagine any other place on the planet I’d rather be today.” She called Salamander a “crown jewel” in Virginia tourism, and said Johnson’s presence reminded her of when First Lady Jackie Kennedy came to Middleburg to spend weekends and fox-hunt. “We’re very appreciative of all you’ve done,” she said. “Our doors will always be open to you.”

With these kinds of accolades, it is no wonder that when Johnson arrived at the podium to make her remarks she was almost immediately in tears. “Boy, what a day,” she said. “I can’t thank you enough for being here. This is the day we’ve all been waiting for.” Pause. Tears. “I’m pulling it together here.” Deep breath. “I have the best friends in the world.” She thanked some who were in the audience —fashion designers Donna Karan and Kay Unger, <em>Project Runway</em> host Tim Gunn, Jackie Robinson’s widow, Rachel Robinson, fashion model Beverly Johnson, her lawyer, Sandy Ain, and Pamela Williams, one of the producers of <em>The Butler</em>.

Johnson then reflected on the journey leading up to the day. “When we decided to mothball this project, I stopped sleeping,” she said of the period after 2008 when construction was halted. “The recession hit us hard.” It took time, but eventually her financial advisers said there was “light at the end of the tunnel” and she could proceed. For her, she said, the resort “is personal. Middleburg was my refuge. In Middleburg I truly found serenity and friendship, and it is home. I want all my Middleburg neighbors to know that Salamander is your partner.” When she finished her remarks there was a second standing ovation, followed by a ribbon cutting, and then the doors were pulled open so the guests could tour just about every square inch, sample food from the kitchen overseen by chef Todd Gray, sip Prosecco, and admire the views — which included, almost as if on a movie set, equestrians on their steeds.

Tucked away on 340 acres in Middleburg, Va. sits the latest addition to Sheila C. Johnson’s Salamander Hotels &amp; Resorts portfolio (which includesHammock Beach Resort, Innisbrook and Reunion Resort). It’s been a long time coming—Johnson first stepped foot on the grounds 10 years ago—but Salamander Resort &amp; Spa is set to open its doors on Aug. 29. Surrounded by the beauty of Virginia’s Horse Country, you’d be hard pressed to find a better locale for a luxury resort with an equestrian flair. Throughout the 168-room hotel, there’s a definite equine flavor; but it’s the perfect balance between elegance and theme. And if anyone knows how to craft a classy horse retreat, it’s Sheila C. Johnson, who serves on the board of governors of Parsons The New School for Design in New York and even funded the college’s Sheila C. Johnson Design Center.

It began with her desire to create a destination spa in the Washington, D.C. region — something that the area has been lacking. Salamander Resort &amp; Spa is a quick (and beautiful) hour drive from the nation’s capital, offering the opportunity to make it a day trip or experience the lavish accommodations by staying overnight. The <a href="http://www.forbestravelguide.com/all-tastemakers#cmpid=forbes_HN">Forbes Travel Guide Tastemaker</a> envisioned her newest property as an iconic respite with a focus on two important parts of her life: her daughter Paige’s love of horses and wellness—with a hefty dose of luxury, of course.

As for the design of the resort, Johnson pulled inspiration from her own home just a few miles down the road. A walk around the resort will unveil striking similarities (for example, the spa courtyard looks a lot like Johnson’s own pool terrace). When you drive down the tree-lined driveway, it feels as if you’re arriving at an old Virginia manor—thanks to the oversized porte-cochère, slate walkways, brick façade, and the steeple on top. In fact, aside from the part that the building is no more than six years old, nothing about the resort shouts “brand new,” which is something Johnson strives for here. Step inside and rather than walking into a traditional lobby, you’ll enter a welcoming living room that appears to be generations old (another aspect that’s completely on purpose).

<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Rebecca Cooper</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

A decade after Black Entertainment Television co-founder Sheila Johnson announced plans to open a quaint little inn in Middleburg, Salamander Resort and Spa opens to the public Thursday. About 70 rooms will be open as the resort slowly works up to operating at its full capacity of 168 rooms.

The resort has been billed as the height of luxury, but it didn't come easy. Salamander faced an uphill battle with its small town neighbors, and the project had to be put on hold in 2009 due to the economic downturn.

Johnson's excitement upon opening the "crown jewel" of her growing hospitality company — she also owns three resorts in Florida — is palpable; she'll be the first guest to check in. Naturally, she's staying in the owner's suite, which is the equivalent of the hotel's presidential suite.

"I want to make sure it all works before the real VIP guests start staying up there," she said. Johnson chatted with me before the grand opening about the resort.

<strong>How are you feeling now that the resort is finally open?</strong> Every time I pull up in the front of the resort, I have this sense of pride. At the same time … it's a little stressful right now, because now you have this beautiful crown jewel and we've got to make it work through the business — through group business and lots of leisure business.

<strong>What made you decide that the market was back?</strong> We got the nod from our bankers, saying, 'It’s time to move forward.' You can’t let a building sit too long … we had already let it sit long enough to ride out this recession. And I really believe, in watching the climate, people are ready to get out of their cocoon and live again.

<strong>Did you ever think that you would just have to move on?</strong> No, I never felt that. I was frustrated that I had to mothball the project. That was scary, and I didn’t sleep at night very well, but never once did I think about abandoning the project. I knew that I could make it work.

<strong>Has the Middleburg community accepted the project now, a decade later?</strong> They are so excited. It's going to boost the economy of the town. I think what it was is they just couldn’t see the vision of what I was able to see. The other thing is that the recession played the right way for me, in the sense that the businesses were having a tough time in the town. I think with this resort opening, and coming to the end of this recession, it's really going to help them out.

<strong>What's next? Do you have any plans for other properties?</strong> We’re constantly upgrading at the other resorts, but hopefully I'll be able to announce a new expansion at one of the other resorts within the next year.

The question comes up at least five times a week, says Dwight Grant, sitting in the sunny barbershop where his clients come to get their hair styled and their ears filled with the latest Middleburg gossip. “Everyone wants to know, what do you think of Salamander?” Grant says. Middleburg, a picturesque town in the heart of Virginia’s horse country, is readying for the Aug. 29 opening of the long-awaited Salamander Resort and Spa. The 168-room luxury hotel — built by Sheila Johnson, Black Entertainment Television co-founder — will open its doors next week after more than a decade of planning, debate and delays. In a community of less than 700 people, the arrival of what’s widely reported to be a $130 million luxury complex, designed to lure high-end leisure lovers and corporate power players, has drawn a range of strong reactions.When Johnson purchased the 340-acre property in 2002 and announced her plans to build a five-star inn and spa, the Middleburg community was split between those who questioned the project and those who welcomed it: Would the development forever alter a cherished way of life in the historic, close-knit town? Or would it offer a needed economic boon?

On a typical Saturday night at one of Middleburg’s downtown restaurants, many of the diners know one another, Grant says. He’s heard people voice concern about how the proximity of the hotel — a seven-minute walk away — might change that dynamic.

But as a business owner, Grant sees the benefits. “It’s hard to attract people from the outside into this community,” he says. “Sheila Johnson is changing that.”

Grant, 35, grew up in Middleburg and has owned the Mens Grooming Room on Washington Street for two years.

“Middleburg is the very attractive woman in the room,” he says of his home town. “You don’t know how to approach her because she’s so attractive. . . . She might seem unattainable, or pretentious. But she’s someone who, deep down inside, wants to be perceived for who she is and not who you think she is.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC – </strong>MGAC celebrated the successful project delivery of <a href="http://www.salamanderresort.com/">Salamander Resort &amp; Spa</a>, a luxury destination resort located on 340 pristine acres of Virginia horse country in Middleburg, Virginia.

The stunning resort features 168 elegant rooms and suites, sweeping public spaces, a state-of-the-art spa, three swimming pools, a fitness center, cooking studio, multiple dining venues, more than 50,000 square feet of unique indoor and outdoor meeting and event space, including a 5,000 square foot Grand Ballroom, and a full-service equestrian center.

Harrimans, the spectacular signature restaurant, features a soaring 42-foot ceiling, octagonal design and panoramic views. Harrimans serves Virginia Piedmont region inspired cuisine, using produce and herbs from the onsite culinary garden, as well as meat, poultry and seafood from local sources in all of its seasonal menu selections.

The Salamander Spa includes an infinity edge pool and cabanas, private outdoor terraces, and 14 treatment rooms, many warmed by fireplaces.

All 168 rooms and suites are spacious at a minimum size of 545 square feet, and also include a separate casual relaxation corner, dining table, full-size desk, and outdoor patio or balcony with dining options. The luxurious bathroom includes a marble shower with body jets, pedestal tub, dual sinks and enclosed water closet.

Founder and CEO Sheila C. Johnson’s vision for the former horse farm of renowned Washington, DC socialite Pamela Harriman was to create a country estate that incorporates uncompromising quality, sustainable practices and healthy lifestyles to benefit resort guests and the Middleburg community alike. In support of sustainability and environmental sensitivity, the resort is registered to become one of the nation’s first new luxury resorts to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.

As Owner’s Representative, MGAC provided comprehensive Project Management services for the resort’s development, including overseeing extensive site work and the construction of a waste-water treatment plant, as well as managing the preservation of historic properties and onsite wetlands in the bucolic Middleburg setting. MGAC’s seasoned Hospitality Project Managers exercised tremendous care throughout the multi-year project to ensure that the results matched Sheila Johnson’s vision of a resort that blended seamlessly into Middleburg’s beautiful and tranquil landscape.

The project team included design architect WATC, architect of record Architecture, Inc., general contractor Turner Construction Company with interior design inspiration from Thomas Pheasant and interior design completion by Kent Interior Design.

The resort is just the latest success story for MGAC, which attracts and retains the best and the brightest minds in Owner’s Representation and Project Management and applies those talents to the most demanding, once-in-a-generation projects, like Salamander Resort &amp; Spa.

<strong>MIDDLEBURG, VA</strong> – With a simple snip of her scissors, Sheila C. Johnson cut through the equestrian-inspired ribbon before her and consigned a decade of planning into memory.

Salamander Resort &amp; Spa was open, and one of the most anticipated hospitality projects of recent memory had become reality.

"I am so extraordinarily thankful for everyone's patience, perseverance, and fortitude," said Johnson, the resort's owner, and Founder and CEO of Salamander Hotels &amp; Resorts. "In addition to its courageous traits, the salamander serves as a symbol of renewal, which is especially meaningful to me today."

The only new luxury destination resort in the United States to open in 2013, Salamander Resort &amp; Spa features a previously unattainable collection of equestrian, spa, culinary, winery, nature and historic experiences for its visitors.

Located in the historic village of Middleburg on 340 picturesque acres in the heart of Virginia's famed horse and wine country, the resort is only 35 minutes from Washington Dulles International Airport and only an hour's drive from downtown Washington, D.C.

Designed to blend into the surrounding rolling countryside and respect the traditions of Johnson's own nearby Virginia farm, which served as the architectural inspiration, Salamander Resort &amp; Spa features 168 luxurious, spacious rooms and suites that far exceed the typical size for a luxury resort. With a full-service equestrian center and an array of programming that includes riding instruction and clinics from the area's world-class riders, Salamander Resort &amp; Spa embraces the region's geographic culture, including jumping and polo. Just a short trot from the property's 22-stall stable, ThorTurf riding ring and nine paddocks are miles of trails on which riders can easily spend a full day. Equine enthusiast guests even have the opportunity to board their own horses.

Drawing on the inspirational venue with treatments that incorporate the surrounding area's rich bounty, the Salamander Spa features 14 spacious treatment rooms with private stone treatment terraces and fireplaces, while the locker rooms include extraordinary vitality whirlpools, aromatic steam rooms, stone Tepidarium chairs and experiential showers. Capping the spa's incredible spatial offerings is a tranquil outdoor courtyard, featuring an infinity pool, private cabanas, whirlpool, fire pit and dining café.

Salamander Resort &amp; Spa's culinary program is overseen by a collection of stellar chefs: Culinary Director Todd Gray, Executive Chef Sean McKee, Chef de Cuisine Chris Edwards and Pastry Chef Jason Reaves. At Harrimans Grill, which features a soaring 42-foot-high ceiling and enjoys a panoramic view of the Bull Run Mountain Range, the cuisine celebrates Virginia's Piedmont region, including a robust selection of steaks, chops, fruits and vegetables. The Gold Cup Wine Bar, designed like a winery tasting room with brick floor and wood-beamed ceiling, features flites of wine from around the world and a creative menu that offers small plates inspired by the Italian Piedmont. Just a few short steps away from the kitchen is a two-acre culinary garden, while the resort also features a state-of-the-art Cooking Studio with a retractable wall affording a view into the resort's working kitchen and three video cameras.

Salamander Resort is positioned at the center of Northern Virginia's emerging wine country, commonly known as D.C.'s Wine Country. There are over 50 wineries located within a 60-minute drive and the closest is only two minutes away from the resort's front doors. Area winemakers will regularly offer tastings at the resort, while private vineyards tours can be arranged for guests, who can enjoy country picnic baskets filled with fresh, farm-to-table cuisine from the resort's kitchen. There is no shortage of other activities to relish at Salamander Resort &amp; Spa, including nature tours of the area, falconry, an outdoor pool area for families, tennis courts, and a Jack Nicklaus Signature golf experience at nearby Creighton Farms Estates.

One of the driving forces behind Johnson's decision to build Salamander Resort &amp; Spa was the relative absence of a luxurious and private meeting retreat in the greater Washington, D.C., region. Therefore, the resort features an array of facilities designed with corporate and association meetings in mind, as well as social functions and destination weddings. This includes the 5,000-square-foot Middleburg Grand Ballroom, the exquisite Hamilton Boardroom, and a variety of stone courtyards with stunning views.

The resort's design architect is WATG from Irvine, CA, while the architect of record is Architecture Inc., of Reston, VA. Project Management was provided by MGAC of Washington, D.C., while the general contractor was Turner Construction Company of Washington, D.C. Interior design inspiration was supplied by Thomas Pheasant, and interior design completion was provided by Kent Interior Design of Atlanta.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Polich Tallix</em></h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

<a href="http://miapearlman.com/">Mia Pearlman</a> is a young, intelligent, and inspiring artist from Brooklyn New York who has spent the better part of this past year at the foundry, rolling up her sleeves along side Polich Tallix Lead Fabricator Mike List during the construction and assembly of ‘Uplift,’ a large scale indoor/outdoor installation for<a href="http://www.libertymutualgroup.com/omapps/ContentServer?pagename=LMGroup/Views/LMG&amp;ft=1&amp;fid=1239999787692"> Liberty Mutual’s</a> new headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. Pearlman’s well thought out design metaphorically bridges together the newly raised building’s flatiron-style interior rotunda with the surrounding streetscape outside.

The sculpture is composed of 8 interior hanging water jet cut 1/4″ aluminum elements, and 10  exterior water jet cut 3/8″ stainless steel elements mounted to a concrete slab. First envisioned by the artist in a fully developed maquette version, our digital media technicians scaled up each object, designed cut files, and water jet cut stock material to identically match the artist’s model. Each element of the final artwork ranges from 10 feet to 20 feet in length. Once the stock metal was cut, each piece underwent a unique journey through our plate bending roller in order to mimic the model’s subtle curves. Polich Tallix engineered, fabricated, and installed all of the sculpture’s elements inside our facility’s south bay prior to its installation in Boston. Pearlman and Polich Tallix had the pleasure of working closely with Kris Collins of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/">MGAC</a> who helped plan and organize the commission, general contractor, engineers and various other involved vendors.

‘Uplift’ is a landmark project for both the artist and Polich Tallix. Pearlman is known for her hand made site specific works in cut paper. She creates surreal environments of layered, delicately cut paper with edges accented in India Ink. Inspired by the recognizable forms of clouds, water, fire, and flowers, Pearlman’s new work invites the audience outdoors to interact with the piece intimately and beyond the bounds of the structural barrier, through concrete and glass, and in to the building. The sculpture’s true magic lies within its ability to become a completely different piece outdoors, and from second floor of the atrium where visitors are able to view the hanging elements at eye level. Further enhancing this transformation with light, both natural and artificial, each silvery figure is soft and subtle on an overcast day, spectacular and alive with shadows in the movement of the sun, and monumental in the evening. ‘Uplift’ is the first work of Pearlman’s in metal, and Polich Tallix’s largest strictly fabricated public work to date.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Washington Business Journal</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Daniel J. Sernovitz</h6>
Residents looking for a place to live near D.C.’s U Street corridor will have more options in the years to come — 620 of them at least — as <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/profiles/company/us/md/chevy_chase/the_jbg_cos/3250079">The JBG Cos.</a> plans to break ground on four new apartment buildings in the area in the next few weeks.

The Chevy Chase-based company recently landed $99.2 million in financing from Capital One to launch its redevelopment of the former Atlantic Plumbing and Supply properties by Eighth and V streets NW, where it is planning a 375-unit, two-building mixed-use project set to break ground by the end of September or in early October. Close by, it is also sketching out the same time frame for another 245 residential units by Florida and Ninth streets, NW.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC, 5 March 2014 – </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/">MGAC</a> announced today that it has completed a merger with <a href="http://www.basisllc.com/">Basis LLC</a>, a leading cost and risk consultancy headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Basis is comprised of former directors of Davis Langdon/AECOM and led by Nick Butcher. Prior to founding Basis, Nick was the former national leader of Davis Langdon’s U.S. practice.

Basis will provide MGAC clients with a cost and risk management consultancy, to ensure that its clients’ goals are met in terms of the cost, value and quality of their project developments.

While the merger was only recently completed, the two firms have enjoyed a longstanding relationship and have already successfully collaborated on projects totaling over $400m across the United States including major aviation, cultural, and corporate headquarters projects.

The merger will allow the two firms to further develop their consultancy practice and leadership in the industry, offering comprehensive integrated project cost, risk and delivery solutions. The combined talent, resources and professional diversity will better serve its national and international client base, expanding MGAC’s presence in California and the Western United States.

"MGAC’s merger with Basis is a natural next step in our long-term strategic goal to provide our clients with market leading integrated project delivery. Nick and the Basis team are acknowledged industry leaders, and bring best practices to further MGAC’s professionalism. The sum is so much greater than the parts,” said Mark G. Anderson, President of MGAC. Nick Butcher concurred. “MGAC is a leading provider of Owner’s Representation and Project Management services across the country with an international presence. We have great synergy in the sectors we service, but most importantly, we share a commitment to thought leadership, to being a trusted advisor to our clients and simply, to being a great place to work for our employees.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC –  </strong>MGAC was named one of Washington, DC’s 50 Great Places to Work today by <em>The Washingtonian</em> magazine. The Project Management firm was awarded the prestigious honor after a panel of <em>Washingtonian</em> editors reviewed more than 200 companies and 13,000 employee surveys. Winning workplaces were selected on a number of factors including:  challenging and interesting work, generous pay and benefits, work/life balance, opportunities for growth, financial stability, commitment to community, and employee recognition.

This is the latest in a series of accolades for MGAC, which has five times been voted one of the <em>Washington Business Journal’s</em> Best Places to Work. MGAC also received honorable mention in <em>The Washingtonian’s </em>2011 50 Great Places to Work competition.

Mark Anderson, who founded the firm eighteen years ago, noted that the award is a testament to MGAC’s employees and clients alike. “MGAC is privileged to work with some of the world’s leading organizations and indeed, with some of Washington’s most talented professionals. Not to mention our teammates in New York, Seattle and Toronto. At MGAC we are entrepreneurial, collaborative, creative and fun. In fact, fun is an MGAC goal.” In that spirit, MGAC is throwing a party to celebrate their win.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC, –</strong><strong> </strong>MGAC completed the<strong> </strong>consolidation and relocation of the <a href="http://www.phe.gov/">Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response (ASPR)</a> for the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>. The office is charged with preventing, preparing for, and responding to the adverse health effects of public health emergencies and disasters.

MGAC was retained by HHS to provide leadership and management of the complex, phased relocation process, which consolidated 593 ASPR personnel from five separate locations into the Tip O’Neill Building, located at 200 C Street, SW in Washington, DC. MGAC managed the coordination of design, construction, IT,
audio-visual and security systems design and installation, furniture design, procurement and installation, and the relocation of ASPR personnel into 150,000 square feet of the 348,000 square foot building. MGAC expertly managed ASPR’s adherence to the HHS directive to reduce utilization rates for personnel to 170 square feet or less per person. As such, the project is an excellent example of a federal agency successfully reducing its real estate footprint, better utilizing office space, and saving the U.S. taxpayer money in the process.

ASPR joins staff from the House of Representatives in the newly renovated federal building which features energy and water-efficient fixtures and low-VOC materials. ASPR carried the green theme into its own space, with a goal of reusing all of its existing furniture. MGAC spearheaded this major logistical undertaking by managing the break down, relocation and reinstallation of all furniture from multiple locations in nine separate moves, all while allowing ASPR to remain fully operational.

MGAC’s strategic coordination of the furniture re-use program allowed ASPR to reuse 93% of its office furniture, achieving $5 million in savings for the federal government. This strategy also shortened ASPR’s purchasing cycle and achieved all the office’s furniture budget and schedule goals.

MGAC is a leader in the delivery of facilities that are based on sustainable design and operational principles and worked closely with ASPR to ensure compliance with Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED) goals for the building, which is seeking Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Washington, DC</strong> – <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seawh-w-seattle/">W Seattle’s</a> celebrated restaurant and bar – one of MGAC’s most notable hospitality projects of 2012 – received additional accolades as a winner in the coveted <a href="http://www.restaurantandbardesignawards.com/entries/winners">UK and International Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards</a>, held last week at London's Farmiloe Building. The awards program receives entries from the world's leading architects, designers and hospitality operators, and W Seattle was one of only two winners from the United States.

The striking renovation, designed by Skylab Architecture, celebrates several of the influences that have shaped Seattle’s culture over the years, including its rich Native American heritage, the aviation industry and the city’s legendary music scene. The inviting, open design Living Room and bar intermixes an inventive collaboration of design elements including 20-foot-tall totem poles and unique wallpaper featuring album cover spines, as well as a spectacular four-story fireplace, covered by nearly 1,000 stainless steel tiles. The adjoining restaurant Trace features a dynamic mural that alternates between two cultural references – a jellyfish for the city’s water-bound locale and an F-18 bomber, a nod to the home of Boeing. Trace has received its own share of recognition from the food and hospitality industries. <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> magazine recently named Trace as one of the country’s Best Hotel Restaurants.

MGAC served as the Owner’s Representative on the project for the hotel management company, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts. Construction management was provided by Abbott Construction. The elaborate new restaurant, bar and lobby area were completed in just twelve weeks, while W Seattle was fully operational.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are-client driven. It’s one of MGAC's <a href="https://www.mgac.com/about-us/mgac-fundamentals">Fundamentals</a>. We exceed our client's expectations, whatever it takes. I was reading an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/movies/sue-the-tyrannosaurus-rex-stars-in-dinosaur-13.html?_r=0">article</a> this weekend about a T. rex skeleton from the Black Hills Institute of South Dakota and it reminded of all the extraordinarily fun things we do at MGAC to fulfill our client mission.

MGAC gets to do so many "once in a lifetime, you would never believe…" sort of activities. They pile up. Once upon a time, on behalf of a client, we purchased a cast of Sue, the Black Hills Institute's T. rex, and assembled it in their space. Sue is the long deceased "star" of <a href="http://www.dinosaur13movie.com/">Dinosaur 13</a>, a new film about her discovery, the ensuing controversy, and legal action surrounding her.

For clients we have arranged a solid ice block martini bar on a high perch above the City of London, hand carried electrical breakers through Customs to facilitate a power startup overseas, shopped at an Ikea located in the Middle East, and negotiated the purchase of fire trucks and aircraft for private individuals. We have coordinated construction material deliveries around the nesting season of bald eagles and the breeding season of endangered sea life. We have been introduced to commissioned artists and project managed their custom art installations in multiple countries. When we started MGAC, it was all about doing the most interesting projects, having fun working together, and being a sound business in that process.

That’s still what MGAC is all about. Now we just get to have fun with a lot more people. It’s what keeps me going in this business: There is still more room for play and new experiences. So when we say we’re serious about serving our clients, it’s because we’re serious about inventing solutions that are interesting, unique and as improbable as a T. rex in your lobby.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All of us in the design and construction industry have a role in ensuring safety on the construction site. One of my favorite structural engineers recently reminded me of the importance of sharing responsibility for site safety as he discussed the many horrific construction accidents he has witnessed. Accidents the victims and others on the sites oftentimes could have prevented.

My colleague has only been home for Thanksgiving 2 times in the last 20 years. This time of year he has an overnight bag packed by his front door. Why? Because somewhere a crane operator, laborer, carpenter or other contractor on the job who is tired, rushing to finish up their work, and cutting corners to get home to their family sooner will inevitably make a mistake that means the worker won’t get to spend the holiday with their family, and neither will my colleague.

Simple carelessness doesn’t just ruin holiday plans. It can ruin entire lives. (For those with sensitive stomachs, you may want to skip ahead a couple paragraphs.)

One project I worked on included two adjacent elevators. They were platforms, not full cabs. Crew on the project had been storing a cardboard box of bolts on one elevator. When that box of bolts broke open, the metal rained down on another worker on the elevator below.

His hardhat was not enough to protect him. The sound he made was all I needed to hear for me to know it was time to call 911. The worker below never worked again, but I don’t envy anyone who was on the other elevator either.

OSHA regulations would likely have prevented this incident today, but those are regulations—not magic protection against danger or carelessness. So, as you are walking a construction project and you see something that looks hazardous, say something. Tell the stories that demonstrate the importance of safety, awareness and responsibilities to your crews so they might remember the mistakes of others when they consider rushing the last hour of work.

We all have a role in making sure we keep construction sites safe, so everyone is home for the holidays.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here at MGAC, we have what we call the glass riddle: How do you procure glass for a domestic project when the glass pane you need is larger than anything domestic manufacturing plants are capable of producing? So, really more of a conundrum than a riddle. Language is imperfect.

On a recent trip to solve the glass riddle I was in the southeast corner of Germany (think three hours south of Berlin, in former East Germany—DDR to the Germans among us). Nestled amidst the former Soviet tank bases and shuttered factories was the solution, a visit to the glass fabricator.

The glass is special because it is large, and complex in its composition. Each panel is roughly 9 feet wide, by 30 feet tall, composed of a combination of an IGU (for the construction nerds reading this) and a laminated structural glass. Each piece this size is roughly 6000 lbs. (a bit more than 2700 kg).

Much of the plant was automated, between heat soaking ovens, large and expensive glass handling equipment, the tempering ovens, a lamination line (not to mention a ceramic frit etching line), but it all comes down to people. How careful they are doing what they do everyday. The workers physically putting it together and their commitment to getting it right, taking their time, and doing the right thing, rather than the expeditious thing will determine our success. That’s what produces superior results. Fingers crossed, I will share this process as it moves forward.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trade work is, despite everything, still a skill.  A construction attorney once told me that his business thrived solely due to the fact that in construction, every project is the prototype. Rare is a "repeat project," where one has the opportunity to improve the project in its next iteration.

Most projects are one-offs, that are never to be repeated, and consequently each project is susceptible to a unique combination of circumstance including: the talent pool available, weather, material suppliers, the quality of project leadership, and the decision making during the course of a project. At the end of the day, just as foreign policy comes down to a pair of boots in the dust somewhere, construction projects come down to intellect, talent, and dedication of a group of construction professionals – from brick layers, electricians, steam fitters, and plumbers, through advanced degreed architects, engineers, and construction managers. It is hard to outsource brick layers or electricians and that to me is an incredibly appealing aspect of construction. The people across this spectrum of talents must find ways of working together, always building the prototype.

In the defense procurement world the prototype frequently seems to be "cost plus," finishing multiples times more than the original estimate, with huge mission creep, and ending up a classic "camel" (horse by committee.)

In the construction world we are always building the prototype, frequently on fixed lump sum agreements, constrained schedules, and subject to damage clauses in our contracts. Perhaps that is why great outcomes on projects can be so rewarding.]]></content:encoded>

		<link>https://www.mgac.com/blog/bim-aspirin-penicillin-or-placebo/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC has worked on major capital projects utilizing the latest in Building Information Modeling (BIM) as the next generation from CAD (Computer Aided Design). Is BIM aspirin (a cure for common headaches,) penicillin (a cure for potentially fatal viruses,) or a placebo (a wan hope of avoiding common illnesses by taking the sugar pill)?

For the uninitiated, BIM utilizes three-dimensional computer modeling and the integration of building systems, (typically structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire protection systems) onto a common software platform to aid in "clash detection" and dimensional coordination. Where traditional CAD has largely been two-dimensional modeling, BIM utilizes a shared platform that allows multiple users access to the same three-dimensional model.

We are currently leading a large and multi-continent diverse project team on a nine-figure project. The integration of BIM across all trades is being taken to an extreme. Finish trades, flooring, stone, and miscellaneous metal trades are all inputting their work into a very large and complex BIM model for coordination. BIM is further supported by the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) part of CAD. We are intensively utilizing BIM models to inform cost, with quantities and materials made intelligently in the models. With an intelligent building model, changes in design are quickly discerned as our cost model changes and is updated by area or building system. This effort has been spearheaded by our Los Angeles based Cost and Risk Management practice.

The BIM model is literally plugged into automated cutting equipment fabricating pipework and intensive mechanical and ductwork systems across a project. The increased use of a shop or factory environment for construction fabrication has exploded over the last decade, with attendant higher quality work outcomes, produced at lower cost, in a controlled environment. Gone are the days (or at least greatly reduced) of a tradesman arriving with a set of drawings and a pile of pipework and fittings. Now large sections of work are fabricated, tested in a factory environment, and brought into place in a much more completed state.

Our country has witnessed this phenomenon in the aerospace industry, and now has undergone the same change in some of the fabrication intensive construction trades (pipework, pipe and pump assemblies, curtain wall systems, and central plant fabrication). Field layouts and dirt excavations are now driven by GPS coordinates fed directly from the BIM model, driving robotically controlled earthmovers and informing on site laser surveying. The temperature adjustments I made in my twenties for pulling a steel tape surveying across large sites are gone.

That said, BIM is an intensive effort, as is laser surveying and the use of automated construction technology. The MGAC project referenced above has incurred substantial cost for implementing these technologies, with the promise that we will avoid dimensional conflict, the typical change order discussions surrounding trade coordination and dimensional busts, and expedited work. The balance of time, technology, factory tested quality control, faster installation, and interactive, real time cost modeling against the substantial human and capital investment is a question not frequently asked as the construction industry races to automate. Perhaps in time, the "premium" of the technology investments to fully model projects across all trades will diminish and disappear as the true cost savings of integrated modeling and costing become apparent, and these technologies become the norm, rather than the special project. For now, we have a vaccine for our common ailments that has the promise to transform the industry.]]></content:encoded>

<h6>By: Barb Galbincea, Northeast Ohio Media Group</h6>
<h6>8/27/2014</h6>
It was not your average groundbreaking ceremony. While there were the usual ceremonial shovels and hard hats, Strawberry Shortcake and a purple Care Bear strolled the grounds as a camera-bearing drone hovered overhead.

American Greetings invited its employees and their families to celebrate Wednesday evening on the site where the company's world headquarters will be built in Westlake, just south of Crocker Park.

The five-story, 650,000-square-foot Creative Studios building is expected to be ready for employees by the summer of 2016.

Morry Weiss, chairman of American Greetings, said the company was "thrilled to call Westlake our home" and pledged that it would take an active part in the community.

Westlake Mayor Dennis Clough said that while he was extremely proud that American Greetings had chosen Westlake for its world headquarters, he was even happier that the company -- which is now based in Brooklyn -- chose to stay in the region.

Clough and City Council President Michael Killeen presented Weiss with a giant envelope containing a huge greeting card welcoming the company to Westlake.

Jeff Hess of Strongsville was one of the American Greetings employees in the big crowd. He said he's looking forward to the move.  "It's going to be great," said Hess, who has worked for the company for 23 years.

Bobbi Kibbey, of Bay Village, said she's especially excited that her workplace will be only minutes away.

A giant screen set up on the construction site gave the audience unrestricted views of the live action, including a performance by the Westlake High School band and, later, music by the Chozen Few Band.

American Greetings treated its guests to dinner under a tent and dessert from a line of food trucks.

Among those who posed for pictures with the American Greetings characters was Geoff Palmer, Westlake's new interim superintendent.

Shortly after getting his picture taken with Strawberry Shortcake, Palmer announced, "It's already out on Twitter."

It is a new beginning for American Greetings, the greeting card company that started in Cleveland 109 years ago.

Company executives broke ground Wednesday on a new world headquarters building in the Crocker Park center in Westlake.

The new, five-story building is scheduled to be open in the summer of 2016.

American Greetings employs about 2,000 people who will move from the company’s current headquarters in Brooklyn.

Westlake Mayor Dennis Clough spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Not only is this a milestone in the corporate history of American Greetings, but it will become part of Westlake’s history as well,” he said.

Clough and City Council President Michael Killeen presented American Greetings with an oversized greeting card welcoming the company to Westlake.

The American Greetings building will be part of a new phase of development that will bring stores, restaurants, apartments and a hotel to Crocker Park.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>Commercial Property Executive</em></h6>
<h6>By: Adrian Maties</h6>
<h6>9/8/2014</h6>
American Greetings broke ground on Aug. 26 on its new headquarters building at the Crocker Park development in the Cleveland suburb of Westlake. Expected to cost between $150 million and $200 million, the project is scheduled to be completed in two years.

The greeting cards company first announced its intention to build a new  headquarters building in Crocker Park in May 2011. A year later, it unveiled the first plans for the facility. Work was scheduled to start by 2012, but the project encountered some problems along the way and was delayed.

American Greetings finalized the transaction to relocate its world headquarters this March. On July 1, it announced the sale of its 1.6 million-square-foot facility in Brooklyn to Industrial Realty Group, one of the largest commercial and industrial property owners in Ohio. Under the terms of the deal, American Greetings will continue to lease space in its current location until the completion of its new world headquarters.

The American Greetings Creative Studios, as the new headquarters is called, will meet all of the company’s needs in spite of the fact that it will be smaller than the Brooklyn facility. Designed by RTKL, it will contain 600,000 square feet of office space and 60,000 square feet of retail on the first floor. A glass-enclosed skyway will connect the building to a five-story parking structure.

The project is good news for the city of Westlake, the Cleveland area and even the state, as it prevents an important company from leaving Ohio. American Greetings will bring more than 1,500 employees to the new location, becoming Westlake’s largest employer and providing a major economic boost to the entire area.

The greeting cards company has hired Washington, D.C.-based MGAC — a project cost, risk and owner’s representation firm — to manage all aspects of the project. The company will provide cost and risk management services, furniture, audio-visual and security systems procurement, and move management services. American Greetings plans to move to the new location in the summer of 2016.

<h6>By: Charles Babcock and Chris Murphy</h6>
<h6>6/2/2014</h6>
The cloud hasn't killed the company-owned data center.

Companies from General Motors to Fidelity are taking the best infrastructure ideas from Web giants such as Facebook and Google and adapting them to their very different business needs in order to build a new generation of data centers.

To highlight the different approaches and strategies these companies are taking, we looked at six companies beyond the Web giants that have made or are planning major data center investments. Our point isn't that data center construction is booming; Gartner forecasts only 2.3% growth in data center spending in 2014, to $143 billion. Companies will spend more than twice that on enterprise software, by comparison, at a growth rate of nearly 7%.

But we are seeing a boom in data center innovation, and it's coming not just from Web and cloud service companies, but from conventional companies that still see running world-class data centers as part of their competitive advantage.

Here's an overview of the innovations that we'll explore in this slideshow:

Fidelity is opening a new data center in Nebraska this fall. The investment giant is one of the biggest advocates outside Silicon Valley for open source hardware, and the new building itself is a modular, just-in-time construction design.

General Motors spent $130 million on a new data center in Michigan, with a second one coming online this summer. It's a private-cloud-meets-mainframe operation, as the company supports both Web-ready apps and long-running legacy software.

<strong>Capital One</strong> christened its new $150 million Virginia facility in March, replacing capacity by third-party operators as the company shifts from an outsourcing strategy to insourcing most of its IT. The goal is to make sure infrastructure doesn't slow down its new Agile development initiatives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Queen's Journal</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Lauren Luchenski</h6>
<h6>9/22/2014</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

After nearly a decade of planning and construction, the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts celebrated its grand opening this past weekend.

On Sept. 20, members of the Queen’s and Kingston community gathered at the waterfront venue located on King St. for the new centre’s official ribbon cutting.

The building was inspired by the lead donors, Drs. Alfred and Isabel Bader. It was designed in a collaborative effort by Snøhetta Design Architects and N45 Architecture.

Following a bagpipe procession and traditional Mohawk opening by Aboriginal Council Co-Chair Marlene Brant Castellano, drama professor Tim Fort led the events as Master of Ceremonies.

Remarks were given by Principal Daniel Woolf, Kingston and the Islands MPP Sophie Kiwala, Mayor Mark Gerretsen, Snøhetta architect Craig Dykers and Board of Trustees chair Barbara Palk. Afterwards, the group of distinguished community members cut the bright purple ribbon alongside the Baders.

The final product of Queen’s newest building has been much anticipated since its groundbreaking on Oct. 1, 2009. Construction was originally scheduled to begin in spring 2011, but was delayed until spring 2012 due to heritage concerns.

Alfred Bader donated a total of $31 million towards the building, which cost $72 million to build. Approximately $30 million came from the provincial and federal governments, $6 million was donated by the City of Kingston and the remaining $5 million was raised by the University.

Isabel Bader said she hopes her vision for the appreciation of the fine art world will reach many.

“I hope [the centre] is for Queen’s and Kingston. I hope it’s for a much wider audience than that,” she said.

With Kingston’s existing art facilities, such as Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre and the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Principal Woolf anticipates that Dr. Bader’s hopes will come true.

“In balance with those existing facilities, Kingston could really become a hub for the fine arts,” Woolf said.

“We’re going to get performers here that probably wouldn’t have come to Kingston otherwise and that’s going to be a benefit to the community. Not just a cultural benefit, but I think there’s economic potential there as well.”

Principal Woolf also said he foresees stronger relationships between the varying fine arts disciplines – drama, film and media, fine arts and music – at Queen’s.

“I think it’s going to be a great opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration between all the fine arts,” Woolf said.

He added that he hopes the new building will attract students to attend the fine arts degree program at Queen’s.

“In the era of student tours, the buildings make a difference,” Woolf said. “Students will come here, see this and say, ‘I can perform here’.”

The <em>Journal</em> reported last week that students were upset over a lack of accessibility to the facility, as well as a shortage of food options.

Despite this, students who spoke at the opening touched on the “magnificence” of the building.

In comparison to the facilities available to fine arts students prior to the Isabel, music student Daphne Kennedy said this is a major upgrade.

“You can’t even really compare – it’s a whole new world here,” Kennedy, ArtSci ‘16, said.

Kennedy, as well as other fine arts students, said she’s aware of the opportunities the facility is presenting for them.

“Being able to bring world-class artists here is going to be incredible. It will be a huge inspiration for us all,” she said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>Construction Dive</em></h6>
<h6>10/2/2014</h6>
The Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts at Queen’s University celebrated its grand opening September 20, 2014. Queen’s University hired Mark G. Anderson Consultants (MGAC) as their owner’s representative in September of 2012, four months after construction started. Queen’s University selected MGAC over seven other firms. Construction finished on time thanks to uncommon levels of cooperation among the project team. The Isabel will be a home for the creative arts at Queen’s University and a hub of vibrant artistic study, creation and exhibition in the Kingston community.

MGAC reconceived the initial project plan to meet the Queen’s University vision for the project and bring in the project under budget. MGAC staff created and monitored a realistic timeline and financial plan that detailed project goals for the entire team and created a shared path to project success. MGAC also worked with the City of Kingston, which was renovating the historical J.K. Tett Building in an overlapping construction zone. This sort of collaboration was typical of the project: “Right up to substantial completion, the entire project team worked together in an unprecedented way to have a world-class concert hall and quality building on time,” Michael Grey, Managing Director-Vice President of MGAC Canada said.

Two project leaders met and solved issues regularly at an ordinary cafe—the meetings themselves, however, were extraordinary. Michael Grey of MGAC, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/press/media-archives/2012/09/07/mgac-to-serve-as-owner's-project-manager-on-the-isabel-bader-centre-for-the-performing-arts" rel="nofollow">the Queen’s University representative</a> met routinely with the general contractor’s project manager as part of the Isabel project’s exceptional collaboration. Together Grey and the general contractor’s project manager drank coffee, solved existing problems, and look ahead at upcoming challenges—an unusual alliance for the construction world. These informal meetings kept the Isabel construction on schedule and avoided the spiral of disputes and negotiations formal requests can cause.

SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC—Renaissance Jaragua Santo Domingo Hotel has begun a one-year, $30-million renovation of its historic hotel.

In addition to giving all of the 300 guestrooms of the Santo Domingo hotel a completely new interior that incorporates a fresh color schedule and modern furnishings, the restoration plans will include new meeting and event space, restaurants, guest common spaces and lobby.

The design of the renovation was inspired by both Santo Domingo’s tropical location and modern design. The renovated guestrooms will feature a color palette of silvers, honey-colored woods and yellows.

The Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel and Casino renovations will also feature a new ballroom, restaurants and meeting spaces. The meeting spaces and ballroom will showcase a “fountains of light” design—a focus on colorful lighting paired with simplistic nudes and silvers—as the focal point of the new rooms, according to the brand.

Renaissance Jaragua Santo Domingo first opened in 1942. The Santo Domingo Hotel is located directly on the Malecon along the Santo Domingo coastline.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>Washington Post</em></h6>
<h6>By Michael E. Ruane</h6>
<h6>9/9/2014</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">
<p id="U820502855566ROE">First lady Grace Coolidge kept a pet raccoon on the grounds.</p>
President Harry S. Truman installed a bowling alley inside.

President Chester A. Arthur wanted to tear the building down.

The White House: Venerable home to U.S. presidents. Symbol of the nation’s continuity. One of the world’s most famous dwellings.

But it is also a place of children, weddings and farewells; of pets, card games and TV dinners; and the occasional upset or scandal.

On Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to attend the ribbon-cutting at the White House Visitor Center, which reopens to the public Saturday after a two-year hiatus for a $12.6 million renovation.

The center, on Pennsylvania Avenue just east of 15th Street NW, is designed to give visitors, with or without an official White House tour, a sense of the history and lore of the building that has been the president’s house for more than 200 years.

Admission is free, and the center will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. all year except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day.
<p id="U820502855566laB">The National Park Service, which operates the center, and the White House Historical Association, which chipped in $7.5 million for the renovation, have filled the center with White House and presidential memorabilia, much of it never displayed before.</p>
The Civil War telegraph key used to respond to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s message announcing that Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House is there.

The green Hammond Multiplex portable typewriter President Woodrow Wilson used in 1919 while touring the country to drum up support for the League of Nations is there.

The big wooden desk that President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to deliver his famous “fireside chats” on the radio is there, in front of a blowup photo of FDR sitting at the desk.

There are also scads of interactive features and virtual views of the house, its rooms and furnishings down through the years.

One hands-on quiz displays servings of simulated foods that were presidential favorites and asks which food was especially liked by which president.

Jelly beans? Ronald Reagan. Rice pudding? Grant. Squirrel soup? James A. Garfield.

The center also displays copies of some of the powerful letters and telegrams received by presidents.

In 1958, Jackie Robinson, who broke major league baseball’s color barrier,wrote a stern letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower after listening to him speak on race.

“You said we must have patience,” Robinson wrote. “I respectfully remind you sir that we have been the most patient of all people. . . . You unwittingly crush the spirit of freedom in Negroes by constantly urging forbearance.”

There’s a moving telegram.
<p id="U82050285556602">On Feb. 23, 1942, among the darkest days of World War II, FDR told the country in a fireside chat: “Your government has unmistakable confidence in your ability to hear the worst, without flinching or losing heart.” That same day, in Bridgeport, Conn., a person named J.B. Manual wired the president: “Just heard your speech. It cheered me up. Received notice today that my son was killed . . . at Pearl Harbor December 7.”</p>
The visitor center was established in 1995 in Malcolm Baldridge Hall, the ornate old Patent Search Office in the Commerce Department building.

There, visitors could pick up White House tour tickets and see some modest exhibits. But since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, tour tickets have only been given out through members of Congress or foreign embassies.

The need for the visitors center was diminished, said Stewart D. McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association. But experts saw an opportunity to expand and enhance the center.

“For people who did get to go to the White House, we could give them a more enriching experience,” McLaurin said at the center Monday.

“For those who don’t have the opportunity to go to the White House, it is as good as you’re going to get to have an understanding of the [White House] as office, home and ceremonial stage,” he said.

Many of the artifacts have been acquired over the years by the association, which was started by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961, he said. Most are stored at a Park Service facility in Maryland when not on display.

“I think that the galleries here and the exhibits here are on par with any presidential library and most galleries at the Smithsonian,” McLaurin said.

There’s also a film about life inside the White House, a bookstore, and pictures of Grace Coolidge and her pet raccoon, Rebecca, and of President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, dining on TV tables.

Among the more striking images are the designs for an altered White House.

When Congress declined to fund Arthur’s plan to tear down the White House and rebuild it in the 1880s, he developed a proposal to erect a garishprivate residence right next door.
<p id="U8205028555667kB">Two administrations later, first lady Caroline Harrison found the White House too small and crowded for the 11 members of her family living there, and planned on huge wings that dwarfed the executive mansion.</p>
Neither plan came to fruition.

Near the center of the exhibit hall is the gilded copper eagle, now somewhat weathered, that watched almost a century of history from the top of the White House flagpole from 1898 to 1993.

“If you’ve lived here, and you’ve been to the White House a lot . . . or if you’ve never been to the White House, this is the kind of place that would give you a real insightful understanding,” McLaurin said of the center.
<p id="U820502855566GnE">Despite her husband’s turbulent presidency, Julia Dent Grant maintained an affection for the dwelling that she made the center of Washington society and home for her four children for eight years.</p>
“I love the dear old house,” she said.

<h6>12/8/2014</h6>
Grand Cayman Marriott Beach Resort, located on the Caribbean island's Seven Mile Beach, recently completed a renovation totaling more than $16 million.

In phase two of the renovation, all public areas of the Grand Cayman resort have undergone a major transformation, including the lobby, restaurants, ballroom, meeting rooms and fitness center.

The ground floor arrival, lobby, bar and dining spaces were designed by EDG Interior Architecture + Design. The inspiration for the new design embraces a ship-to-shore concept that embodies the themes of the spirit of openness, sense of adventure, craftsmanship and the island's strong connection with the sea, according to the resort. The resort's guestrooms were overhauled last year with phase one of the renovation.

The choice of the furnishings' color palette reinforces the use of natural light. There is an emphasis on neutral and light colors such as white, beige and tones of gray. Different shades of blue have been incorporated to remind guests of the sea.

Different textures such as polished wood, leather and weaved fabrics for the furniture creates fun, modern but comfortable seating arrangements for guests, according to the resort. Wood is featured heavily within the fixtures.

Central to the renovation is also the rebranding of the lobby, restaurant and bar into Anchor &amp; Den. Alfresco dining is offered at the newly revamped oceanfront restaurant and bar. Renamed Veranda and Vista Bar, the space features vintage-inspired decor.

As part of the resort's services, amenities include free Linus bike rentals and complimentary snorkeling gear, which guests can use to explore the Artificial Reef Project, a short swim from the hotel's beachfront.

<h6>By: Michael Vincent</h6>
<h6>9/15/2014</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

Congratulations it’s a girl!

Named the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts, the multidisciplinary complex is housed overlooking the shores of Lake Ontario, on what was once a brewery and military hospital. After seven years of planning, it’s finally ready to unveil itself during Isabel’s inaugural season opener, September, 21st 2014.

The multidisciplinary space was commissioned by Queen’s University as a means to showcase not only student work, but also world-class talent.

“The need for a ‘proper’ concert hall in Kingston has been discussed for decades and finally in 2014 we have a hall to call our own,” writes former Director, Jerry Doiron, who programmed the first season.

The concept behind the space is a kind of multidisciplinary Swiss army knife, which can accommodate both teaching and public concerts, as well as provide exhibition space for the Queen’s School of Music, the Department of Drama, Department of Film and Media, and the Bachelor of Fine Arts program.

The structure claims an adaptable 100-seat blackbox studio theatre, a specialised film screening room, a large flat floor music rehearsal room, production studio, film edit suites, art gallery and teaching seminar rooms.

The crown jewel of The Isabel is the 500-seat concert hall, which flaunts an impressive –N1– acoustic rating, making it an ideal space for the most delicate classical music performances, in any context.

It also features distinctive acoustic drapery that can be adapted with a flick of a switch to suit the needs of chamber groups, orchestras and rock bands.

Behind the Isabel’s blue-ribbon acoustics is the US-based ARUP acoustics and audio-visual consulting firm, who designed the hall (in its natural state) for small to mid-sized chamber classical music.

The field of architectural acoustics trace back over 100 years with Wallace Sabine (1868-1919), who is widely considered to be the father of modern acoustics. “There were also Roman texts on acoustics, and the Greeks also did amazing work on the subject. If you look at their Epidaurus and their amphitheatres, it was known that people had learned from precedent of what worked, and what didn’t work, but as a modern field of science, it is basically over 100 years old,” says Stoway.

Stoway and his partner Matt Mahon have been working on the project since its inception in 2007. Based in New York City, they have been a part of many high-profile projects, including the Oslo Opera House, the World Trade Centre Pavilion, the second Avenue Subway system in Manhattan and the 2,100-seat Maison symphonique de Montréal. They have also worked with a number of sound artists , and art gallery sound installation projects.

They began collaborating on the design process alongside the Norwegian firm Snøhetta, and Ottawa-based N45 architects – first meeting with faculty and staff from Queen’s University, who were impressed with ARUP’s vision and reputation for creating pristine acoustical environments.

“We sat down with [Queen's] film and drama and the music faculty in early 2008 and asked, what is this room going to be used for, and how many performances it’s going to have? From that we derived what size the room needs to be to acoustically make it work,” Solway said. “After blocking out the space, we further refined the plans in a totally collaborative process.”

They used a special 3D design modeling program to map out the proposed design specifications into a virtual acoustic space, that gave them the ability to listen to the concert hall before it was even built. “…We developed a space we call the Sound Lab, and it’s a room where we can recreate the acoustics of spaces we are designing or what we’ve gone and measured,” explains Solway. “It’s a visually immersive aural environment.” […] “What was key to our approach is that we like to model through listening.”

They also made a mockup of the concert hall using 24 of the actual seats used in the space in the controlled environment of their advanced acoustics lab.  “…Seats and people are the main absorbing elements in a room, so we measured that in an acoustic test lab and fed that into our listening process.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>IT In Canada Online</em></h6>
<h6>9/15/2014</h6>
CenturyLink Technology Solutions recently opened its third data centre in Canada and its second in the greater Toronto area. If the company has its way, TR3 in Markham will not be the last.

Three executives from CenturyLink shared their thoughts on what the company has accomplished in Canada, where it stands now, and how it plans to grow in the True North.

Jeff Von Deylen, president, CenturyLink, provided some background on the company’s history in Canada. “We acquired Fusepoint five years ago,” he said. Fusepoint was a managed IT colocations services provider. “We had clients in Canada that we couldn’t service, and Fusepoint had three facilities, customers and a distribution network,” Von Deylen added. “With the Fusepoint acquisition, we gained scale.”

“Fusepoint was known for managed services,” added Ash Mathur, VP and country manager, Canada, CenturyLink. “It still is, but we’ve got an expanded portfolio.” The Canadian branch of CenturyLink offers customers colocation, cloud, managed hosting, managed security and managed networks solutions.

After acquiring Fusepoint, CenturyLink gained a dedicated base of customers in Canada. Their base was so strong that demand grew for another data centre facility. CenturyLink operates a data centre in Vancouver and Mississauga, ON. David Meredith, SVP and global GM, CenturyLink, emphasized that Canada plays a strategic role in CenturyLink’s growth plans. He explained that the company has been considering expanding in the GTA. Customer demand rose sharply in the past 15 to 18 months. “We love Canada,” he remarked. “It was a high priority to get a data centre in Canada.”

“Customer demand led to an acceleration [of the company’s plans to open a data centre],” Meredith commented. “Customers wanted more space, more power, more exposure to the cloud.” With those factors in place, it became a clear decision to open a new facility in the GTA.

CenturyLink executives believe that the company’s data centres, especially TR3, meet a need in the Canadian market. “Businesses need agile, flexible services,” Von Deylen asserted. “We allow customers to buy cloud services when they need them and pay for it when they can. They can buy colocation services or dedicated servers through an automated system in an agile way.” Mathur reiterated Von Deylen’s statements: “Our value proposition is colo-managed cloud and the ability to scale globally.”

Now that the data centre is open, CenturyLink’s goal is to educate potential customers about the benefits it offers. Mathur noted that CenturyLink is repositioning itself in the Canadian market in order to increase its customer base. “Repositioning is about helping customers understand our full suite of services and helping them understand the value we can provide them, such as thought leadership,” he stated.

Von Deylen and Mathur acknowledged that repositioning has its challenges. “We’re going to work to be more well known by working with partners in the application layer,” CenturyLink’s president remarked. “It takes time to build a brand,” Mathur added. “We need to have more customer success stories and we need to build upon that success. Part of it is raising our significance and reach in Canada. We need to build our partner ecosystem, and we’re building our profile in the marketplace. It’s a long term journey.”

What do the CenturyLink executives predict for the company’s future in Canada? “We’re focused on the GTA’s explosive growth,” Von Deylen commented. “We’re making the right decision.” He went on to say that TR3 will expand in phases. When asked where he sees CenturyLink going, Mathur responded, “I see us helping to educate the market and provide a suite of services.” He pointed out that it makes more sense for many businesses to let a trusted partner manage things such as their cloud, because it is better for them to focus on running their companies.

“We’re going to look to continue to expand,” Meredith remarked. “Once we fill this building, we’re going to get another building. We can help Canadian customers who need to do business outside of Canada [because of CenturyLink’s 57 data centres across the globe]. Multi-national corporations outside of Canada now have the option to come into Canada. We’re just getting started,” Meredith concluded.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from Rockefeller Center website</h6>
This summer, Jeff Koons's Split-Rocker makes its New York City debut at Rockefeller Center, to coincide with the opening of his retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Presented by Gagosian Gallery and organized by Public Art Fund and Tishman Speyer, Split-Rocker is a spectacular planted form that towers over 37 feet high and features over 50,000 flowering plants. It was first exhibited at Palais des Papes, Avignon in 2000; and subsequently at Château de Versailles (2008) and Fondation Beyeler (2012). It is also in the collection of the Glenstone private museum in Potomac, Maryland, where it has been on view since June of 2013.

Consistent with Koons's persistent fascination with dichotomy and the in-between, the inspiration for Split-Rocker came when he decided to split and combine two similar but different toy rockers, a pony belonging to his son and a dinosaur (“Dino”). The slippage or "split" between the different halves of the heads gives an almost Cubist aspect to the composition. As the model was enlarged to the scale of a small house, the split became an opening, a profile, and a light shaft. In contrast to his legendary Puppy of 1992, which was presented by Public Art Fund at Rockefeller Center in the summer of 2000, Split-Rocker suggests the idea of a fantasy shelter. Whereas the singular form of Puppy is closed and sculptural, the combined form of Split-Rocker is architectural and hollow.

<h6>By: Barbara Hoffman</h6>
<h6>6/25/2014</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

Rockefeller Center has a new centerpiece — all 37 feet and 50,000 flowers of it.

It’s Jeff Koons’ “Split-Rocker,” a mammoth topiary the Public Art Fund unveiled Wednesday at 30 Rock, right where the Christmas tree usually stands.

Inspired by his son’s rocking horse and a toy dinosaur, Koons melded the two heads into one Picasso-like asymmetrical whole, with “handles” protruding from each side. Live flowers — begonias, geraniums, petunias and more — color the sculpture, watered by an irrigation system within its stainless-steel armature.

If you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu, well, you should: Koons’ massive, flowery “Puppy” was unleashed on Rock Center 14 summers ago.

But “Split-Rocker” is just the tip of Koons’ iceberg: His first New York museum retrospective opens Friday at the Whitney Museum of Art — five floors of the 59-year-old artist’s patented blend of innocence and erotica.

Prepare to be amazed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>Metropolis Magazine</em></h6>
In the beginning was the cubicle. And the cubicle was almost everywhere, and the cubicle held almost everyone, and it was good. Then there was the backlash, and the cubicle was destroyed, put aside, swept away in favor of the open plan, the endless span of space, floor, and ceiling—punctuated by the occasional column so that the roof wouldn’t collapse onto the floor plate—and everyone talked about collaboration, togetherness, synergy, randomness and happenstance. Renzo Piano designed a <em>New York Times </em>building with open stairways so writers and editors could (would have to) run into one another, and everyone remembered the always-ahead-of-the-curve Steve Jobs who, when he was running Pixar, asked for only two bathrooms in the whole Emeryville building, and insisted they be put on the ground floor lobby so that designers and renderers could (would have to) run into each other, and such was the office culture of the new millennium.

And then there was the backlash to the backlash. Those writers wanted their own offices, and editors wanted privacy, and not everyone wanted to be running into people all the time, because not everyone was actually collaborating, even though their bosses and their bosses’ bosses said that they should, because collaboration, teamwork, and togetherness—these were the new workplace buzzwords. Until they weren’t. Until people realized that they were missing—as architect Ben Jacobson said in a Gensler sponsored panel on the need to create a balance between focus and collaboration—the concept of “parallel play,” i.e. people working next to each other, but not necessarily with each other. Until individuality came back, particularly in San Francisco in the tech scene, and particularly in the iconoclastic start-up tech scene, where people began to want something a little different.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Washingtonian</em></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">By: Will Grunewald</h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">6/10/2014</h6>
<p class="sfnewsContent">At MGAC, a construction-management firm, the rules are simple: no growling, no biting, no excessive barking. Petting, nuzzling, and fetching, on the other hand, are encouraged.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">Most days, only humans occupy the company’s contemporary offices across the street from the Grand Hyatt in downtown DC. On Fridays, though, their dogs can join them.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">Controller Elaine Maddalena owns Oscar, a beagle, as well as Gordon and Cosmo, German short-haired pointers. The three take turns visiting on Fridays, loping from desk to desk to greet familiar faces but mostly lounging at Maddalena’s side. “Everyone seems happy to have them around,” she says. “And the dogs love the attention.”</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">In response to employee requests, human-resources director Mollie O’Donnell devised Dog Fridays two years ago. The idea was to increase employee happiness and encourage positive work relationships and team building. The theory is that dogs make workplaces feel friendlier and less hierarchical—if your boss offers to walk your dog, it can soften the impact when he or she tells you to finish a report by the end of the day. “They bring a really nice change of atmosphere,” says CFO Matthew Anderson, owner of Gizmo, a Pembroke Welsh corgi. “If you have a meeting and you know it’s going to be tense, you can just bring him in and it changes the dynamic.”</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">The soft and fuzzy benefits of workplace pets are borne out by numbers. In 2005, researchers from the Center for Human-Animal Interaction at Virginia Commonwealth University found—using blood and saliva samples—that therapy-dog sessions reduced levels of stress-related hormones in health-care workers. In 2012, they followed up by studying self-reported stress levels in office workers. In employees who didn’t bring dogs to work, stress rose throughout the workday. In those who did bring dogs, stress dropped as the day went on.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">Still, only 5 percent of US companies allow pets, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. Lisa Orndorff, who heads employee relations and engagement there, says workplace pets aren’t always a good fit. Companies have to account for allergies or phobias, and in industries such as food service and manufacturing, the presence of pets would be neither safe nor practical.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">Orndorff says companies that decide to allow pets need to establish rules about animal behavior and hygiene and make sure animals are up to date on immunizations. Also, though owners are generally responsible for damage or injury caused by their pets, companies should consult with legal counsel to clarify potential liability.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">At Anthony Wilder Design/Build, an architecture firm in Cabin John, owners and employees embrace the pet-friendly ethos. The renovated red-brick firehouse is specially equipped to cater to canines: Cubicles are fitted with baby gates to keep dogs in place, file cabinets are filled with dog chow, and there’s a cleanup-bag dispenser outside. “We know they bring us joy and happiness and help us be more productive at work, so we make accommodations for them,” says Elizabeth Wilder. She and husband Anthony co-own the company and always bring their two rottweiler mixes, Tank and Izzy, to work.</p>
<p class="sfnewsContent">Dogs are allowed every day, and most days there are four or five. Some employees like to take their dogs running on the nearby C&amp;O Canal towpath during breaks. Others enjoy strolling around the neighborhood. Marketing director Danielle Frye has been bringing Lily, a rottweiler/German-shepherd mix, almost every day since she got her as a puppy four years ago. “If you’re having a stressful moment,” she says, “it’s really nice to hang out with a dog.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As an owner’s representative, I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside many great leaders and brilliant business minds. I’ve represented them, debated with them, vetted them as project partners, and celebrated with them after a collective job well done. Every business is run differently, based on their own unique business model, core values, and culture; and to each their own I say. But every exposure to another’s business has taught me something about my own. I’ve found these observations in the field to be invaluable learning opportunities that continue to impact how we run, and market, our business.
<h4>THERE’S POWER IN ALIGNMENT</h4>
At a recent business meeting, I witnessed a presentation about Southwest Airlines. Southwest’s mission statement is simple: “wheels up.” When the airplane is on the ground, it is losing money. When the airplane is in the air, it is making money. Everyone at Southwest understands that, and they’ve adopted the “wheels up” mentality as their collective battle cry. I was amazed at the simplicity of this powerful statement. In two simple words, Southwest is able to align and articulate what drives both their business and their culture.

A defined mission creates clarity in any business, even if it’s not as elegantly spoken as Southwest’s. Recently I was interviewing for a project with a large Pacific Northwest retailer we all admire. They began the meeting with this simple statement: “We sell shirts. If this project doesn’t help us sell more shirts, it is not aligned with our goals, and we won’t do it.” Simple and to the point. Though they surely have a vibrant corporate culture and artfully crafted mission, vision, and core values, they’re able to uphold them while maintaining laser focus on the bottom line. Every decision they make is based on the answer to one question: Will this help us sell more shirts?
<h4>IDENTIFYING YOUR CRAFT</h4>
Despite advancements in technology, the business of building still belongs to the craftsmen. I have the privilege to regularly observe craftsmen practicing their trade. Working on one of our projects, in my opinion, are the best stone masons and finish carpenters in Washington, DC. Watching them work, make mistakes, solve problems, cut and fit materials, and get the best out of the design and materials provided to them in the time they have to do it is in one word, remarkable. One quickly realizes that these men and women practice more than a trade, they practice a craft. Creatively getting more out of a situation than seems likely, or even possible. They bend materials, design, and adjoining work into something better than the sum of its parts. They produce the 110% outcome.
<h4>MY MOMENT OF ZEN</h4>
Reflecting upon these three examples of very different, yet very impressive businesses, it suddenly seemed obvious to me that MGAC’s mission has been, is today, and must continue to be “better outcomes.”

For us, outcomes can be reducing the cost of a project, or even finding the right contractors, suppliers and subcontractors to yield an extraordinary project. Outcomes can have multiple layers, from timeliness of delivery, to the continuity of a client’s business operation, to proper deployment of cutting edge technologies. They can include choosing what and how much to build, or not to build at all. Our craft is combining intelligence and experience with creative thinking to yield better outcomes.

The facilities, design, and construction world is full of examples of failed projects. I often think design and construction efforts are like mountain climbing (like watching construction, another of my pastimes), take your eyes off what is going on, where you are going, and how you are getting there for even a moment, and things can go off the rails very quickly. Better outcomes. Maybe not as catchy as “wheels up,” but we’re just as passionate about our outcomes as they are. Anything less, and we have not practiced our craft.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, July 22nd, I attended the <a href="http://marylandsuburbancrew.org">CREW Maryland Suburban</a> tour of the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/nzertf/index.cfm">National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Net Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF)</a> with a client. This particular client is exploring the option to renovate an existing commercial office building achieve Net Zero energy and water, and we wanted to see firsthand the strategies that NIST employed to make their design successful. What from the outside looked like a standard suburban home, was anything but, and opened our eyes to the potential of Net Zero Energy becoming a part of our every day lives.

Our tour guide, <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/building_environment/afanney.cfm">Dr. Hunter Fanney</a>, the NIST engineer that has guided the project from conception through design and construction to actual real time data success, was a wealth of information. It was an exceptional tour that allowed us to walk all corners of the house and see the equipment in operation and to understand how it works.
<h4>ENCOURAGING PROGRESS</h4>
The NIST “virtual” family of four moved into the NZERTF home in June 2013. NIST collects and tracks over 400 data points per minute based on how the “family” is programmed to use the home. The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/nzertf/previous-research-results.cfm">results after the first year</a>, June 2013 to June 2014, prove that the family saved over $4,500 in electric bills and even returned 4,200 kilowatt hours back to the grid for a refund of $570. Even more encouraging, it is expected that they will improve and benefit from even greater savings this year over last.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/simulated-kitchen-and-systems.jpg" alt="simulated-kitchen-and-systems" width="700" height="400" />

With one exception, NIST used all American-made equipment in the house, which was encouraging to our client. It proves the technology exists in this country to go beyond code compliant energy efficiency to not only achieve Net Zero energy, but to actually return power to the grid. Part of the strategy’s success included angling the solar array on the south face of the house to a perfect angle of 38%, the same as the geographical latitude of the home/building location, to maximize production from the panels (who knew?!). They also installed three different geothermal systems which are being tested and compared for efficiency.
<h4>THE FUTURE CHALLENGE</h4>
NIST has modeled the cost difference between their NZERTF house and one that would meet the Maryland residential energy code based on 2012 IECC (which was <a href="http://energy.maryland.gov/codes/">updated in January 2015</a>). The adjusted cost to build the NZERTF house (without land) was $656,000 compared to the 2012 code model at $493,000 for a premium of $163,000. This represents a 33% increase in initial cost with an annual cost savings of $4,500, resulting in a 36-year payback period. Of course this calculation does not include the potential federal, state, and utility incentives that might help to offset some of the initial construction cost premiums, such as Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). There are also the non-monetary benefits to the consumer involved in delivering a more comfortable and healthier environment. In short, the cost to build the NSERTF house on the NIST campus, to its exact specifications, is not yet a financially viable and repeatable model for the typical consumer.

A larger scale development of similar houses will require a public awareness with proven and documented statistics on not just why it’s the right thing to do, but how the consumer will benefit and save long-term based on the increased initial investment. If the public is informed and asks for Net Zero, which we’re already starting to see happen, the builders will be incentivized to build it. And if the government regulates it, manufacturers will find a way to build it efficiently and economically. The consumer will want to know the benefits of the resale of a Net Zero home, and right now the market rate and assessment benefits have not yet been proven in the market. Time will tell how the market will respond when the facts are available.
<h4>WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY</h4>
Right now, many commercial developers are only looking to meet LEED standards and most are operating under a short-term ownership strategy. This differs drastically from the residential consumer, who is typically a longer-term investor. But that doesn’t mean the commercial real estate world can’t learn from these smaller scale efforts.

Net Zero energy efficiency design strategies save real operating dollars and create a healthier building. This translates to high-performing building and a healthier environment for the tenants working in the building, ultimately supporting higher revenues and faster leasing and sales. These benefits, plus the alignment with their corporate mission are what is driving our current client to explore the option, and I’m excited to take this journey with them. Educated consumers are going to demand Net Zero in the future. Smart owners of commercial buildings should position themselves to be on the forefront of this movement, capitalizing on the fact that Net Zero design strategies will be particularly attractive to the long-term owner or investor.
<h4>HOPE FOR CHANGE</h4>
NIST’s work has proved that the technology exists to build a building, on the scale of a home, using no more electricity than it produces. They’ve also created a viable system to track and produce real time data on various strategies and make it available to the world. As we know, information is power (pun intended) and as consumers and owners become more educated and sophisticated, equipment manufacturers, developers, and homebuilders will be forced to comply with the demand.

The hard work continues. NIST did not include Net Zero water into their design, and those strategies need the same level of proven track record and cost metrics to make headway in the marketplace. The good news, though, is that it is possible. We can design and build in a sustainable way, using the free power of the sun and earth to do so, and clients are starting to take notice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since its inception, part of MGAC’s mission has been to <a href="https://www.mgac.com/about-us/giving-back">give back</a> to the local communities in which we work. Regardless of the cause, a commitment to making a meaningful impact on the lives of others is a core part of who we are. Over the years, we have worked with countless organizations, forming long-term relationships and donating our time, talent and resources to helping advance their missions and expand their impact.

Today we kick off our Featured Philanthropy series as another way of helping to spread the word about these amazing organizations. In that spirit, we bring you the first in this series, featuring an organization that is very near and dear to our collective heart, Calvary Women’s Services.

We sat down with Heather Laing, Development Director with Calvary Women’s Services, to learn more about the organization, where it’s been, and where it’s going. Here’s what she had to say about the future of this year’s <a href="https://www.calvaryservices.org/2015/05/calvary-womens-services-commended-for-excellence-in-nonprofit-management/">honorable mention winner</a> of The Washington Post Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management.
<h4>Q: WHO ARE THE WOMEN OF CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES?</h4>
A: Women who come to Calvary Women’s Services are homeless. They may be survivors of domestic violence, they may live with mental illnesses, they may be in recovery from addiction, or they may have other health issues. But they want to change their lives, and we give them the means and support to do that. Through our programs women set and achieve their own goals, with a focus on building skills for stronger futures. We know our programs work: every five days a woman moves from Calvary into her own home.
<h4>Q: WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES?</h4>
A: I came to Calvary Women’s Services so that I could put the skills I have in resource development to work making a difference for women. I get to see women transform their lives and to know that my work helped make that possible. It’s also a real pleasure to be able to connect supporters and volunteers to Calvary – to help people find ways to give back that are meaningful for them and to see the impact and the joy that creates for everyone involved.
<h4>Q: HOW HAVE YOU SEEN CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES EVOLVE SINCE YOU’VE BEEN WITH THEM?</h4>
A: Over the 13 years I have been at Calvary Women’s Services it has grown significantly. We have added a third housing program, expanded our education and mental health services, and launched a job placement program.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-112" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hope-road-ribbon-cutting.jpg" alt="hope-road-ribbon-cutting" width="640" height="428" />

Most notably, four years ago we purchased a new building on Good Hope Road in DC’s Anacostia neighborhood, and with support from MGAC and other partners, we were able to renovate that to serve more women and expand our services. A vacant building was <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/calvaryservices/sets/72157628733069317">transformed</a> into a beautiful new home for 45 women with space for all of our health, education and employment programs. We moved in two years ago, and the difference it has made is amazing.
<h4>Q: WHAT’S YOUR MOST MEMORABLE CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES SUCCESS STORY?</h4>
A: One woman who comes to mind is Jill, who was a survivor of domestic violence and who came to Calvary Women’s Services when she was early in recovery from addiction. She had dropped out of school in sixth grade and had never been able to secure employment that enabled her to support herself.

When she moved from our previous location in Chinatown to our new home on Good Hope Road, she was blown away by new space. She told us how much it felt like a home, and she took advantage of the new programs we were able to offer. Jill took all kinds of classes, attended daily relapse prevention meetings and learned practical skills like how to open a bank account.

Now she lives in an apartment in our Sister Circle housing. She has maintained her sobriety and this summer will complete her GED program. It’s always amazing to me to see women achieve goals like this, things that may have seemed impossible at one time. Women have the gifts and strengths to build on, and Calvary provides the personal support and resources that make it possible.
<h4>Q: WHAT WILL THE NEXT TWO YEARS LOOK LIKE AT CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES?</h4>
A: Over the next two years, Calvary Women’s Services will continue to grow our programs that we know women need and that we know will have a real and lasting impact on our community. We will expand our job placement program, Step Up DC, connecting more women with jobs. We will continue to grow our mental health services. We are also planning for additional permanent, affordable housing for women, following the model of our successful Sister Circle program. To do all of this, we will create new opportunities for volunteers and supporters to get involved and make a difference.
<h4>Q: CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES JUST RAISED OVER $300,000 AT THIS YEAR’S HOPE AWARDS DINNER. HOW ARE THOSE DONATION DOLLARS PUT TO USE TO HELP THE WOMEN OF CALVARY?</h4>
A: <a href="https://www.calvaryservices.org/2015/05/calvary-womens-services-hosts-14th-annual-hope-awards-dinner/">The Hope Awards Dinner</a>, for which MGAC was the presenting sponsor, supports Calvary’s housing, health, education and employment programs that women use to change their lives. The event brings together community and business leaders to celebrate hope – which is what these programs provide. We put those donation dollars to work: providing women a safe place to live, making home-cooked meals, offering skills building classes, and much more. When people support Calvary – through the Hope Awards Dinner or otherwise – they can be confident that what they give matters and will be used well.

<h4>Q: HOW CAN PEOPLE SUPPORT OR GET INVOLVED WITH CALVARY WOMEN’S SERVICES?</h4>
A: One of the things I love about Calvary Women’s Services is the fantastic community of people who make all of this happen. There are opportunities to offer <a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/calvaryservices">financial support</a> or to donate items from our <a href="https://www.calvaryservices.org/donations/">current wish list</a>. For people who prefer to be more hands on, we have a family of over 350 <a href="https://www.calvaryservices.org/volunteer/">volunteers</a>. We are always happy to have new folks joins us to do everything from serving meals to leading classes to spending the night with us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I joined MGAC colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4544403&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=HLOB&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1433256243523%2Ctas%3Ajerry%20walters">Jerry Walters</a> and more than 8,000 hospitality professionals, leaders, and experts in Las Vegas for this year’s <a href="http://www.hdexpo.com/">Hospitality Design Expo and Conference</a>. A three-day event full of exhibits, continuing education and networking, we go for one reason – to hear firsthand from clients and partners where the hospitality industry is moving. With almost 30 sessions making up the conference program, we chose to stick with roundtable and panel formats that allowed us to speak directly with our clients, the owners, about the trends and issues that matter most to them. Here are six key themes that we took away from those discussions.
<h4>THE TALENT GAP IS REAL, AND SO ARE THE CONSEQUENCES</h4>
A major thread that seemed to run through discussions across the Expo is the shrinking talent pool and the impact it is having on the industry. This is especially true in the design fields where young talent are moving away from the industry right as they are gaining the experience to achieve valuable specialization. The challenge on everyone’s mind is how the industry can motivate retention in a world with long hours and admittedly low pay.

Within our own profession, project management, owner’s expressed a lack of depth when it comes to experience. They are seeing strong junior PMs, as well as trusted experts in upper management, but the absence of middle management has created an atmosphere where existing talent is spread too thin, causing projects to fall into the weeds too easily.

Owners themselves have their own challenges to deal with as they struggle with the pressure of getting projects done within compressed schedules. The lack of talent is impacting their ability to effectively meet project milestones as less experience combines with quick turnaround to result in costly project complications. Even when issues are identified, teams don’t seem to have the experience or sufficient resources to manage the complex challenges.
<h4>DISCUSSION OF GREEN WAS LEAN</h4>
As we reflected on topics that stood out, it dawned on us that one key theme was noticeably missing. Still a hot topic in the program schedule, sustainability seems to take a back seat in our conversations with the owners. Now this isn’t to say that there aren’t owners out there doing it and making it a priority. It just didn’t receive the focus that one might expect at a conference meant to discuss trends in the building industry.

One reason may be that hoteliers aren’t seeing the financial value of seeking LEED certification in their properties just yet. But we don’t see that lasting long. With many companies and professional organizations taking a stand on sustainability as a part of their core values and corporate responsibility programs, we see the hotel industry needing to catch up in order to attract and retain their business. This is especially true when it comes to government organizations, whose conferences, meetings, and travel account for a significant chunk of the hospitality industry.
<h4>THE BIG BRANDS ARE BECOMING POLARIZED</h4>
Obvious throughout the three days of conversations was the significant growth being experienced across the extended-stay and limited-service markets. An unfortunate result of this new trend will be the increased polarization of big brands like Starwood, Hilton, Marriott and Wyndham, who seek to have a presence across the variety of price points in the market. With money seemingly filtering to their high- and low-end properties, we’re left wondering what will become of the stagnating mid-price full service brands? Is this the beginning of the end for these travel mainstays? Our guess is no, but it will be interesting to see how they continue to compete for business while investment funds are flowing elsewhere.
<h4>SECONDARY MARKET CITIES ARE ON THE RISE</h4>
Hellooooo…Denver? That’s right, cities like Denver, Philadelphia, Nashville, and Houston are some of the hottest cities for hospitality development right now. The discussion of secondary market resurgence seems to be a direct result of these gateway cities working to reinvent themselves to attract a new generation of business and tourism to their area. Appealing for their uniqueness and authenticity, these markets are now playing catch up when it comes to having the capacity to support the influx of visitors.

A particular challenge for the hospitality industry seems to be the lack of availability of existing buildings that can be converted into hotels. According to owners, the only way to serve these markets moving forward is to build. This will present a unique challenge for developers, and the cities themselves, as they attempt to balance new development with the authenticity that drew investment in the first place.
<h4>GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT IS BACK</h4>
A year ago, no one was talking about ground-up development. But this year we noticed owners were not only talking about it, they were excited. According to owners, finding a deal on existing and well-stabilized hotels has become increasingly difficult, and those properties they can find typically have poorly maintained infrastructure that will cause complications down the road. The high cost of bringing the property back up to par is no longer worth the investment, especially for those owners who are trying to get ahead of the curve. With the average daily rate on the rise, it now makes better financial sense for owners to turn to new development to expand their existing portfolios.
<h4>TECHNOLOGY STILL NEEDS TO PROVE ITSELF</h4>
Another topic that we expected to play a larger role in discussions was technology. A hot topic across industry publications, it doesn’t seem that innovations such as 4K television panels and robot butlers have earned a seat at the table just yet. A big reason is that owners are waiting for new technologies to be thoroughly tested and vetted before they risk investing. We can certainly sympathize. Discussions with our own clients reveal that they don’t know what to implement, how far to go, or how much to invest while available technologies continue to change at a break-neck pace.

For now, it seems that most are investing in improving the customer experience through technology upgrades and increased convenience and connectivity through free WiFi and the addition of plugs and charging stations across the entire property.

We had a great time at HD Expo 2015 and learned a lot about how we can better serve and represent our clients in the upcoming year. Hope to see you there next year!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Should architects, engineers, and construction professionals be held to the same standard of care as doctors and attorneys? The City of Victorville says yes, and they have the settlement to prove it.

Acting solely in another party’s interest. That’s how Cornell University’s Legal Information Institute defines the term <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty">fiduciary duty</a>. Doctors and lawyers are subject to it every day as they serve the general public who undeniably depend on the knowledge and experience of these professionals to represent their best interest in a time of need. Those who abuse that power, to put their own interests above those of their patient or client, are subject to litigation and potential loss of their ability to practice their chosen profession.
<h4>SETTING PRECEDENT</h4>
I recently read an article published in the New York Law Journal by the law firm <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Content/PDFs/fiduciary-duty-claims-against-construction-and-design-professionals.pdf">WilmerHale</a>. The article, “<a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Content/PDFs/fiduciary-duty-claims-against-construction-and-design-professionals.pdf">Fiduciary Duty Claims Against Construction and Design Professionals</a>,” indicates that courts have held that this similar expectation, one of fiduciary duty, can be construed to exist between, in their specific example, an engineering firm and its client. The cited case, City of Victorville v. Carter &amp; Burgess, sought reparations “for the costs of the unfinished job,” and “a breach of fiduciary duty claim for Carter &amp; Burgess’ alleged poor-quality designs and failure to supervise the project’s development.” The case resulted in a $52 million settlement for the City of Victorville.

We recently worked on the correction of a rather significant "bad project" where lack of complete design documentation, coupled with a high degree of owner directed change, and further complicated by an immovable completion date resulted in a poorly coordinated construction effort. The result was the delivery of an unsafe, incomplete, and poor quality product. Throughout the project, and the resulting mediation, the term "standard of care" was thrown about frequently.
<h4>FIDUCIARY DUTY V. STANDARD OF CARE</h4>
This begs the question, where do we draw the line between standard of care and fiduciary duty in the design and construction industry?

In short, standard of care can be summarized to mean that a firm in question performed to the level of competency found by similar firms on similar projects in similar locations. Architects, engineers, and contractors building single story wood framed houses have a standard of care different from architects, engineers and contractors delivering dense urban high rises, or complex data centers. The skills, care and knowledge base required are inherently different.

A fiduciary responsibility is altogether above normal and accepted standard of care, regardless of the complexity of a particular project. And though precedent has been set, City of Victorville v. Carter &amp; Burgess will most likely remain an exception to the rule for now.
<h4>BUYER BEWARE</h4>
A client seeking to procure design and construction services should be aware that the industry as a whole presumes standard of care is the accepted measure, and not fiduciary responsibility. As professional services firms, our ability to provide quality services that meets our clients’ needs are of the utmost importance to ongoing success as a business. However, the definition of quality and approach to customer service differ from firm to firm and are influenced more by a company’s ethical standards than their standard contracts.

Unfortunately, not all contractors, architects, engineers, project managers, or real estate advisors/brokers work from the same set of ethical standards. Smart purchasers of these services take this into account, and make informed decisions based on the motivations and reputations of the companies under consideration. When it comes to these qualifiers, we are not all equal. Just ask the City of Victorville.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Washington lost a great business leader who was instrumental in transforming the landscape of our nation’s capital and whose national construction firm made us all better at what we do. A. James Clark was a recognized icon in business and construction, and built an impressive company with committed employees and devoted clients.

Beginning as a concrete layout engineer with George Hyman Construction, Mr. Clark went on to transform the company into one of the nation’s largest construction companies, forever changing the course of general contracting and construction. Mr. Clark was an entrepreneur operating in a large business. In the 1970s and 1980s, Clark was at the forefront of changing Washington real estate and construction from family businesses and largely unionized construction into what it is today. Mr. Clark started Omni Construction in the early 1980s, which drove the construction industry to largely open and merit shop construction. Companies which dominated construction at the time included Blake Construction, Volpe, and Charles H. Tompkins. These companies are gone, or have largely disappeared from this transformation.

Omni brought new faces, new practices, and followed booming growth from Washington’s family developers, including Oliver Carr Company and John Akridge. This transformation of the industry moved general contracting away from “builder” contractors to the Omni model of subcontracting, helping to further companies such as Miller &amp; Long. Omni and Hyman were eventually morphed into the single entity of Clark Construction and construction in Washington was never the same. And it never will be. Despite the firm’s exceptional growth, Mr. Clark always invested in Washington, DC and he never forgot his local roots as seen through the firm’s many philanthropic engagements in our city and the greater metro area.

MGAC has been fortunate to work with Clark Construction and their subsidiary companies on many occasions, from interiors projects to base buildings. We are proud of our many years of partnership which have resulted in memorable projects throughout the DC metro area, from our first projects as a company to the exciting work we do today.

The Clark legacy will foster project-based teams that come together to problem-solve, causing real momentum that rolls projects to completion. Mr. Clark left an exceptional legacy – from the bricks and mortar projects located on almost every street corner across DC to his savvy business sense and benevolence in the local community.

We thank him and his firm for their contribution to our industry and our society. One of our true greats will be greatly missed.]]></content:encoded>

<h6>6/7/2015</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

The Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts received the first Ontario Association of Architects Lieutenant-Governor's Award at the association's Centre of Excellence awards in Hamilton last month.

Accepting the award was the architect of the building, Ottawa-based N45 Architecture.

Lt.-Gov. Elizabeth Dowdeswell presented the award, the highest honour given out for architectural work in Ontario.

The event showcased the best in architectural design and innovation by Ontario architects.

Twenty buildings designed by Ontario architects were also given Design Excellence awards. Some of those buildings are in Toronto, St. Petersburg (Russia), Georgian Bay, Sudbury, Sarnia, Oakville, Port Hope and Surrey, B.C.

The Isabel, which opened last year at 390 King St. West, next to the Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning, is a $72 million, 80,000-square-foot performance hall, which also acts as learning space for Queen's University students from the theatre, music, film and media faculties.

The building features state-of-the-art ventilation, acoustics and soundproofing -- including two-foot-thick walls around the performance hall. The architects preserved and revitalized original brick and wood from the historic structures previously located on the site, maintaining the architectural significance of the building.

<h6>2/9/2015</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

When Australian artist Jonathan Zawada was putting the finishing touches this month on a 36-foot-by-12-foot acrylic painting that blends the natural landscape of mountains with the pixelated virtual reality of the video game world, it was not at his Los Angeles studio. And the work will not be featured in an art gallery.

Zawada was painting a wall inside the downtown Washington offices of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, the global law firm that commissioned his work for the firm’s new office. The yet-to-be-named artwork, which is made entirely of brightly colored triangles, takes up a wall of Pillsbury’s first-floor conference center and can be seen from the street through the building’s floor-to-ceiling glass windows. It is the first time that Zawada, whose artwork is typically in private collections, has created a piece for a private company.

Corporate law firms, which for many evoke images of stuffy oil paintings and oriental rugs, are increasingly home to never-before-seen works by artists who trade in light installations, lithographs and metal sculptures.

The trend is a stark contrast from a generation ago, when law partners were known to amass expensive art collections. Of course, many law firms still maintain expansive, curated collections. But increasingly, law firms are commissioning artists to create tailor-made pieces that fit the more modern architecture and aesthetics of the firms. The phenomenon is playing out at law firms across the city.

The main lobby of Covington &amp; Burling, the District’s largest law firm and anchor tenant at CityCenter DC, will soon be home to Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez’s first major installation in the Northeast, which will incorporate natural light coming through the building’s glass walls.

McDermott Will &amp; Emery, which in 2013 relocated its Washington office to a newly designed building on Capitol Hill, commissioned two pieces — a series of 17 lithographs by New York City-based artist Peter Coffin and a 20-foot LED lightbox by Spencer Finch, the Brooklyn-based artist who was later selected to offer the only artwork commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial Museum. The lightbox Finch created for McDermott, “Summer Afternoon, 1863, Washington, D.C.,” re-creates the afternoon sunlight at the street corner in Washington where Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln passed each other regularly during the summer of 1863.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from<em> New York Times</em></h6>
<h6>2/9/2015</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">
<p id="story-continues-1" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="326">John C. Whitehead, for decades one of New York’s most prominent citizens, a veteran of D-Day who capped a lauded career on Wall Street and in the State Department by shepherding the first years of the city’s fractious effort to rebuild after the 2001 terrorist attacks, died on Saturday at his home in New York. He was 92.</p>
<p data-para-count="143" data-total-count="469">Haverford College, from which he had graduated and where he served on the board of managers, announced his death, saying the cause was cancer.</p>
<p data-para-count="405" data-total-count="874">The columnist Liz Smith once called Mr. Whitehead the “chairman of the establishment.” He helped pilot Goldman Sachs to the forefront of investment banking and led the boards of Harvard, the Asia Society and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among other institutions. As deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, he helped wean the countries of Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p id="story-continues-2" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="1033">His connections were so broad, he said, that in 10 minutes of conversation with “just about anyone,” he could find “a mutual friend we both know well.”</p>
<p data-para-count="324" data-total-count="1357">Mr. Whitehead’s stiffest challenge came as he neared his 80th birthday, when Gov. George E. Pataki of New York asked him to be chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. A state entity, it was given the mandate to rebuild the shattered site of the World Trade Center towers and revitalize downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p data-para-count="166" data-total-count="1523">In his autobiography, “A Life in Leadership: From D-Day to Ground Zero” (2005), Mr. Whitehead recalled replying that he would be ancient by the end of the effort.</p>
<p data-para-count="186" data-total-count="1709">“I don’t think you want me down there a decade from now in my wheelchair, pointing my cane at some building and saying, ‘I’ll put this building here, not there,’ ” he wrote.</p>
<p data-para-count="212" data-total-count="1921">He decided to turn down what was then his city’s, if not his country’s, most momentous job. Then he changed his mind. As he had many times, he felt a call to duty. He concluded that he had no right to say no.</p>
<p data-para-count="126" data-total-count="2047">“When the fireman hears the bell go off, he’s off to the fire,” Mr. Whitehead wrote. “And I guess I heard the bell.”</p>
<p data-para-count="164" data-total-count="2211">The reality of the decision hit him after the news conference where Mr. Pataki announced his appointment. Mr. Whitehead had no staff, no money, not even an office.</p>
<p data-para-count="91" data-total-count="2302">“That moment in the car was probably the loneliest moment of my entire life,” he wrote.</p>
<p data-para-count="330" data-total-count="2632">For five years, Mr. Whitehead juggled the competing interests of local residents, business leaders, cultural groups, the city, two states, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and families of the victims of the attacks. His agency conducted 200 public hearings and produced a master plan that changed greatly but endured.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <em>Fierce Cable</em></h6>
<h6>1/30/2015</h6>
<p class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) reported strong fourth-quarter residential subscriber metrics, highlighted by residential video declines that slowed by 75 percent to just 38,000.</p>

<div class="sfnewsContent">

Overall, TWC gained 54,000 residential customers in Q4, adding 168,000 residential high-speed Internet subscribers and 295,000 residential voice subs during the period, the latter being an all-time fourth-quarter mark for the company. The MSO also added 273,000 triple play customers, another Q4 best.

New York-based TWC reported a revenue increase of 3.8 percent for the quarter to $579 million and narrowly missing investor forecasts on earnings per share of $2.09.

TWC CEO Rob Marcus attributed the increased subscriber relationships to improvements in technology and customer service, reporting an 18 percent decline in customer trouble calls in Q4. TWC, for example, finished rollouts of DOCSIS 3.0-based Maxx broadband services in New York and Los Angeles during the quarter.

With both AT&amp;T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reporting decreases in video subscriber growth, Marcus conceded that TWC was more competitive in markets in which TWC has overlap with the telecoms.

"We did do well in U-verse markets. We did well in FiOS markets, too," he said.

Marcus delivered his Q4 address to investors Thursday as numerous investors began to ponder the increasingly real possibility that the Federal Communications Commission ultimately will reject TWC's $45 billion purchase by Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA).

Marcus, however, would not indulge this speculation, noting that TWC is still operating as if the merger is an inevitability. The company did not deliver full 2015 guidance or a dividend--as it usually does in its Q4 report--in preparation of a deal closure it still expects to occur in the first half of this year.

When asked about Dish Network's (NASDAQ: DISH) disruptive new OTT service, Sling TV, Marcus struck a dismissive tone that mirrored that expressed by Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) during its Q3 call last spring--TWC supports the notion of stripped-down programming bundles, but it believes its base content packages offer customers more and render Sling TV not so special.

While coy, Marcus was more effusive when the subject of Cablevision's new Wi-Fi calling service, Freewheel, was brought up. "Using Wi-fi as a component of a voice product is pretty intriguing," he said.

<h6>6/19/2015</h6>
<div class="sfnewsContent">

Welcome to The Washington Post’s annual roundup of Top Workplaces, our attempt to identify the best places to work in greater Washington.

The 150 organizations that made the cut this year scored the highest all-around when we surveyed their employees. We asked people to evaluate their employers on a host of factors, including the quality of leadership, pay and benefit practices, and work-life balance issues.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dre/capital-business/top-workplaces">[Meet the 150 companies that employees love the most in the D.C. area]</a>

Funny thing, it is often not the pay and perks that push companies to the top of our list. Research by our partner in this project, the employee survey firm WorkplaceDynamics, found that while just more than half of all respondents said pay and benefits were important factors in how they viewed their employers, far more, over 75 percent, said it was important to feel connected to their workplace through meaningful work and the belief that their company is moving in the right direction. A whopping 71 percent of the people surveyed at our Top Workplaces said they genuinely feel appreciated by their employer. Two-thirds feel confident about their future, and almost as many expressed confidence in the leadership.

Take a look at the place you work. Do you buy in to where the organization is heading and how it is getting there?

It’s our hope this report provokes a wider conversation on just what makes an organization stand out.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This annual event provides children with a solid foundation to begin the new school year as well as access to replacement supplies throughout the year. With the help of the many volunteers who participate, the <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/JubileeSupportAlliance/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=155160559446">Jubilee Support Alliance</a> was able to give over 100 children an opportunity to get off to a great start with the school supplies necessary for a successful year. Each child received a grade specific “bundle” pack of supplies, along with a backpack and other accessories. MGAC volunteers had a blast helping to package "bundles" at the office for the kids and participating in the Saturday Back to School Store Event.For more information about the wonderful services provided by <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/jubileehousingdc/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=1624859361059872">Jubilee Housing</a> and the Jubilee Support Alliance, and how you can get involved, visit their website at <a href="http://www.jsadc.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jsadc.org/</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, MGAC had the privilege of hosting a select group of clients for an intimate discussion with Ruben Ramos Arrieta, Cuba’s Minister Counselor of Economic and Trade Office at the Cuban embassy in Washington, DC. He was joined by Reuben Smith-Vaughan, the Director of the Americas for the International Affairs Department of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to share updates on the evolving relationship between the two countries – and the upcoming business opportunities available to interested developers willing to invest in Cuba’s strategic growth. Through their respective roles, both of our featured guests have shared the task of reintroducing American businesses to the Cuban market, and helping to overcome entry barriers by demystifying and facilitating the process. During the two-hour event, they did just that for the twenty hoteliers and developers in attendance – openly discussing the goals, challenges, and strategies that are going to shape the future of doing business in Cuba.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-82" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/doing-business-in-cuba-event.jpg" alt="doing-business-in-cuba-event" width="822" height="310" />
<h6><em>Left: MGAC's Sean Delaney welcomes Reuben Smith-Vaughan. Right: Ruben Ramos Arrieta answers questions from developer guests with MGAC's Mark Anderson looking on.</em></h6>
&nbsp;

It’s clear that a lot of progress has already been made, and that the U.S. and Cuba have a long way to go before the real and perceived barriers are fully addressed. In the meantime, here are some encouraging takeaways from our discussion.
<h4>THE CUBAN ECONOMY IS HEATING UP.</h4>
The Cuban economy is growing and the US and Cuban governments are working together to lift the blockade and update legislation. Currently, US companies are still not able to freely access the many business and investment opportunities that are a part of Cuba’s long term strategic growth – but this will change, and sooner rather than later.
<h4>THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IN CUBA NEEDS TO GROW – AND FAST.</h4>
Cuba’s existing hotel inventory only contains approximately 62,000 keys, which is inadequate to support the current demand of visitors to the country. In 2015 alone, they saw 3.5 million visitors, a 17.4% increase over 2014. This number will continue to grow, especially once the travel ban on US citizens is lifted. To make up for the lack of hotel rooms, the tourism industry is supported by a very strong Airbnb market – the company’s fastest growing market ever. But the long term plan is to invest in new hotels in major tourism hubs like Havana and other cities across the island. Over the next few years, Cuba hopes to double the number of rooms and introduce preferred brands to their hotel offerings. In fact, Starwood has already made its way to Cuba and is currently managing properties on the island.
<h4>INVESTMENT IS NEEDED ACROSS ALL DEVELOPMENT SECTORS.</h4>
While it may be two to three years for the embargo to be lifted, there is no limit to the opportunities in Cuba across all sectors. For the last 50 years, and worsening in the last 25, there has been a vast shortfall in investment required to upkeep the country’s existing infrastructure and services, never mind expand to meet the growing demand. Though hospitality was the focus of our discussion, it became clear that the country’s development needs are more diverse than just hotels. Aside from infrastructure needs, there is also a marked shortage of quality office space to support the influx of businesses looking to put down roots in Cuba.
<h4>THE INCENTIVES ARE THERE.</h4>
Cuba is doing its part to incentivize short, medium, and long term investment in their growing economy. They already have business and trade relationships with 75 countries around the globe, and now they have set an annual target of $2 billion in foreign direct investment. To hit this goal, they’ve enacted Law No. 118/2014 to set a new, more attractive legal framework for foreign investment, including protection against expropriation and assurance of the free transfer of dividends, profits, and other income abroad. Tax incentives included in the framework make companies exempt from the 35% tax on general income for the first eight years of their incorporation, with a 15% tax after that. If investors focus in the new Mariel Development Zone, they are exempt for ten years followed by a 12% tax.
<h4>THE TIME TO INVEST IS NOW.</h4>
If investing in Cuba is a part of your company’s long term growth strategy, now is the time to get started. Both Mr. Arrieta and Mr. Smith-Vaughan attested to the fact that doing business in Cuba is going to take “getting to know Cuba.” While direct investment will be nearly impossible until the unilateral sanctions are lifted, this is the time to do your research and develop the relationships and networks necessary to navigate the process once the gates open. Be assured, it will happen and when it does it will be one of the most unique, and in my opinion, the most vibrant development opportunities we will experience in our lifetime. The greatest obstacle to overcome, and I have heard from multiple sources, is trust. Cold War politics have isolated the island nation from its closest neighbor with the majority of public opinion derived, on both sides, not from firsthand exposure and experience, but stereotypes, wide sweeping generalizations, and the media. Rebuilding trust will be the first and primary goal, dispelling the long held images created from 50 years of separation. The best way to accomplish this? Get in there and understand the lay of the land, their culture, values, and priorities.
<h4>THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT.</h4>
If you are not already a member, we encourage you to join the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/members/join-chamber">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>. Membership with the U.S. Chamber, which represents the interests of more than three million businesses, provides firsthand access to future informational seminars, delegations, and current events as the relationship and government policies change and evolve.

Obtain and familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.cubabusinessreport.com/cuba-portfolio-for-foreign-investments-2015.pdf">Cuban Portfolio of Foreign Investment Projects</a>. There are currently 326 opportunities identified and this document is updated annually.

Contact our speakers to participate in future U.S. company delegations traveling to Cuba. These trips are arranged periodically and provide an opportunity to interact with the members of the Cuban government.

Use MGAC as a resource. We intend on remaining actively engaged with our speakers and other persons spearheading the U.S.-Cuba relationship normalization process. We look forward to accompanying a future U.S. Chamber delegation to expand our network and deepen our knowledge of the development and construction procedures in Cuba.

The 2016 election is the most important election since 1932 because of major policy differences between two parties, said Henry Aaron in his December 2015 article for Brookings Institute. How could these policy differences impact the economy and therefore the construction industry?

Because the construction industry is very much impacted by the U.S. economy, we decided to dig deeply into two major presidential candidates’ (Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump) policies and see what impact if any would have on the construction industry, if enacted. Bernie Sanders is still in the race as of this writing, but this report assumes Hillary as the presumptive nominee.

Given the complexity of the hypothetical question, we first looked at historical data from 1947 to 2016, to determine if there were any relevant patterns between the presidential terms and the performance of the construction Gross Domestic Product. We then compared the stated policy proposals on corporate tax and infrastructure spending of both presidential candidates. In addition, we reviewed two major policy areas – international trade and immigration policy, as they relate to the construction industry through material costs and labor costs.
<h4>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li><menu>There is no obvious correlation between the presidential terms and construction GDP as a percentage of total GDP. The construction GDP is strongly correlated with the total GDP and demonstrates bigger swings to market climate changes; currently, the construction GDP is growing at a faster speed than that of the total GDP, leading to an increasing proportion of the construction GDP within the total GDP.</menu></li>
 	<li><menu>In terms of tax policy, Hillary Clinton favors taxing higher incomes, and encourages investments in infrastructure and community; whereas Donald Trump’s proposal would reduce tax rates and lower the cost of capital. A study published by the American Economic Review has found that a tax increase by 1 percent of GDP lowers real GDP by roughly 2 to 3 percent2. Given the strong correlation between GDP and construction GDP, Trump’s proposal of tax reduction appears to create incentives for the economy and thus the construction industry.</menu></li>
 	<li><menu>For infrastructure spending, Hillary Clinton has put forward a detailed five-year $276 billion plan that is estimated to create roughly 3.6 million jobs in total, with 2.4 million in the construction industry, based on the job creation estimate by the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the period after 2012; Donald Trump has not proposed a detailed infrastructure spending plan, but has called for a “1-trillion dollar rebuilding plan”, frequently citing deteriorating infrastructure in the United States including airports, roads and bridges. Indeed, estimates for Trump’s proposed border wall have ranged from $10bn to $20bn, depending on the source of the estimate, and at those levels would comprise between 4% and 10% of Hillary Clinton’s infrastructure investment.</menu></li>
 	<li><menu>In terms of Donald Trump’s policy on the international trade and immigration, we found that imposing a tariff towards China could potentially increase construction material costs in the short-term, but could also encourage domestic manufacturing for the corresponding materials. As for deporting undocumented immigrants (representing 12% of the labor force in the construction industry based on 2012 data from Pew Research Center), the construction industry could suffer a severe labor shortage, which would then translate into higher construction and operating costs.</menu></li>
</ol>
The analysis should be treated as a cursory review of available data and campaign promises; and as such it is far from statistically sound or empirical evidence. Ideally, indicators such as construction spending and the architecture billing index should be included to measure the activities in the construction industry. However, the publicly accessible data for construction spending GDP only goes back to 2003, and the architecture billing index starts from 1997.

In addition, some stated policies by the candidates lack details, which adds difficulty to the analysis. Lastly, many economic factors are by nature correlated and are almost impossible to estimate in dollar values.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bisnow Lodging and Innovation Conference was a busy and bustling event – the first conference I’ve attended with MGAC. Which happens to be my first employer out of college.

To best illustrate the Bisnow event, I would compare it to a talk show. The stage was organized in an informal and intimate way, the chairs were set up in a circle and the lights were low. A host kept the audience warmed up between panels. And there were giveaways, the most notable of which was one of those high-tech toilets you may have seen in Japan.

But the real reason to attend was of course the speakers. Some of them, like Bob Sonnenblick, spoke to large scale issues: “If you bought land already, it is a great time to build; if you are trying to buy land, it is not a good time to build because it is hard to finance.”

Others spoke to small scale issues: Niki Leondakis of Combined Lodgings Group has a bone to pick with hotel staff who are “pleasantly unhelpful.” These are the smiley employees who tell you there’s nothing they can do about your problem.

One of the biggest themes of the conference was the changing terrain of the hospitality market, and if I were to take one thing away from the conference, it would be this: Consumers in the hospitality market today are beginning to crave an authentic, local experience – as a millennial, if I am visiting a new city, I want to experience the city as the locals do, partaking in local food, local sights and local sounds – and this is one of the main reasons that hoteliers are starting to take Airbnb seriously!

There was of course much more to the conference than these highlights; you can read all about it in more detail in the report below.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been a busy few weeks for Airbnb. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Prop-F-Measure-to-restrict-Airbnb-rentals-6609176.php">Their successful campaign against a San Francisco ballot measure</a> that attempted to apply new restrictions to the number of days hosts can rent their property each year has kept them in the headlines of national news. Proposition F, defeated 55 percent to 45 percent, would also have required Airbnb hosts to formally register with the city. In the wake of this landmark victory, Airbnb’s head of global policy and public affairs, Chris Lehane, declared of the company’s momentum and growing community, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/technology/airbnb-pledges-to-work-with-cities-and-pay-fair-share-of-taxes.html?_r=1">This is now a movement.</a>”

A recent <a href="http://www.hanyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HVS-Impact-Study-FINAL-Airbnb-and-the-NYC-Lodging-Market-11-05-15.pdf">report</a> by the <a href="http://www.hanyc.org">Hotel Association of New York City</a> finds that the numbers support this sentiment, forecasting that Airbnb market share in NYC, currently 7.8% of demand, will continue to grow over the next three years. This same report details the $2.1 billion negative impact the study calculates Airbnb had on the NYC lodging industry and larger economy in 2015, including loss in ancillary revenue, labor, construction and development, and local, state and federal taxes.

Now that Airbnb has proven the ability to defend its interests and influence public policy, it’s looking to use that voice in the political conversation to build bridges with local municipalities before more regulations are proposed. On November 11th, they released the <a href="https://www.airbnbaction.com/compactdetaileden/">Airbnb Community Compact</a>, a pledge from Airbnb focused on “three commitments with specific actions we’re taking to help ensure home sharing continues to make communities stronger.” The first of these commitments is to “Treat Every City Personally and Help Ensure Our Community Pays its Fair Share of Hotel and Tourist Taxes,” directly addressing that aspect of the negative economic impact outlined in the NYC report.

At the same time that Airbnb is making headlines for it’s disruptive impact on the hotel industry, major hotel brands seem to be nonchalant about the company’s growing market share. As recently as an <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/28/investing/airbnb-hilton-hotels/">October 28, 2015 article for CNN Money</a>, Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta is quoted as saying, “I strongly do not believe that they are a major threat to the core value proposition we have.” Much of this confidence seems to stem from Airbnb properties’ inability to provide the types of luxury amenities, level of service, and customer rewards programs frequent, and especially corporate, travelers expect. "As we speak to our largest corporate clients, we're confident that Airbnb will not satisfy a meaningful piece of their demand," Nassetta states in the article.

But that hasn’t stopped Airbnb from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/business-travel-worth-300b-airbnb-wants-share/">trying</a>. They currently have partnerships with <a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/business-travel-airbnb/">Concur</a> and American Express, two mainstays of the corporate travel industry, going back as early as July 2014. This July they <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150720006003/en/Airbnb-Launches-Global-Product-Suite-Businesses#.Va0kkCpVhHw">launched a new set of products</a> aimed specifically at making their service easier to use for companies and business travelers. And just this month they’ve <a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/americanexpress/">strengthened their relationship with American Express</a>, allowing card members to link their accounts with the two services and apply their rewards points directly to Airbnb reservations.

It seems regardless of the reason for travel, travelers are seeking a more authentic experience in their accommodations. We’ve seen this resonate within the larger hospitality industry in the form of an upswing in renovation projects where big brands seek to improve customer experience at their existing properties through “localization” strategies, including design and material selection, the types of products for sale, and even the restaurant partnerships they choose. Additionally, many brands have started new ventures focused specifically on targeting travelers seeking a local experience, such as <a href="https://skift.com/2015/05/29/lifestyle-hotels-look-for-a-local-edge-to-stand-out-in-the-market/">Hyatt’s recent introduction of Hyatt Centric</a> in Chicago.

As much as Airbnb and traditional hoteliers seek to differentiate themselves from each other, they certainly do seem to be taking cues from each other as well. While hoteliers strive for the local experience Airbnb is known for, the $25 billion startup is investing in customer loyalty programs and corporate incentives that have long served the industry well. Does the future find them meeting somewhere in the middle?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>MGAC inducted into the "Toughest Companies Club"?</h5>
I have always thought that was reserved for the most air miles flown, or the most "difficult" situations resolved well, but in this case it is for MGAC's completion of the <a href="https://toughmudder.com">Tough Mudder</a> event in Philadelphia last weekend. Over one in ten of us MGACers slithered, crawled, swam, climbed, ran, walked, wriggled and dropped for ten miles in the hills of Southeastern Pennsylvania. If you don't know what a Tough Mudder is, <a href="https://toughmudder.com/obstacles">read up</a>. It made the front page of the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579266602539891902">Wall Street Journal</a>. Ten miles of obstacles, hills and challenges in unseasonable cold and wind met their match against MGAC's determination. The prize? A single beer and a headband. No "winner," just "Mudders."

Conceived by a British Special Forces team member, the Mudder challenge is simply to finish together, as a team. We did. The experience of working together, against discomfort, adversity, mud, electrical shocks, heights, feats of strength, endurance and will left us all a closer bunch. MGAC moved as one, as quickly as our slowest member, through increasing cold, hypothermia and fatigue. But together. It was a great lesson in leadership, provided by our own Mike Lee, that he kept us together and working toward our end.

Thank you to everyone who came, carried, clambered, climbed, jumped, oozed, and persevered. We saw a challenge, and met it. Another day at MGAC.

<h6>10/13/2015</h6>
Renaissance Hotels, the global lifestyle hotel brand recognized for helping guests discover unusual travel experiences, announced the reintroduction of the <a href="mailto:http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sdqgw-renaissance-santo-domingo-jaragua-hotel-and-casino/">Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino</a> in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

The property underwent a yearlong $40 million renovation that began in 2014 to completely revamp the property’s interior and amenities, making the Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino the leading lifestyle hotel in Santo Domingo.  As the property plays a prominent role in the cultural history of Santo Domingo, much detail and effort went into the preservation of the hotel’s historic aspects and blending them with ultra-modern design elements.

“Santo Domingo is a historic city in the Caribbean with rich tradition and a vibrant local culture.  We are incredibly excited to unveil the renovated Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino and invite our guests to discover the local flavor of Santo Domingo,” said Dan Vinh, Vice President Marketing, Renaissance Hotels.

Built in 1942, the hotel has played a role in Santo Domingo culture for 73 years. The property recaptures the spirit, culture, and design elements that made the Santo Domingo Jaragua hotel an icon. The Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino features a Navigator – the hotel’s lifestyle concierge — who provides guests with an exotic, alluring and vibrant experience that will transform any trip into an inspiring journey.

Located in the heart of the oldest city in the New World, the Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino features 300 guest rooms and suites, executive lounge, a sprawling outdoor pool, casino, tennis club and a state-of-the-art fitness center and spa.  The property includes ten meeting spaces equipped with the latest technology and boasts the La Fiesta theater which hosts up to 1,200 guests.

The Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel &amp; Casino is the third hotel in Marriott International’s Dominican Republic portfolio following the 2014 opening of the JW Marriott Hotel Santo Domingo and the Courtyard Santo Domingo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, October 17th, a team of MGAC staff, family and friends bundled up and traveled the two and a half hours from Washington, DC to Philadelphia to participate in a Tough Mudder. Taking on ten miles of unseasonable cold and wind, the team slithered, crawled, swam, climbed, ran, walked, wriggled and dropped their way to the finish line, learning a lesson in teamwork and leadership along the way. Congrats to Michael Lee, Mark Anderson, Megan Cowman, Oliver Fox, James Partridge, Jerry Walters, Rebecca Rankin, Sophie Krhounek, Billy Rose, Dermot Ryan, Grant Bartlett, Otto Orr, Andrew Vivirito, Henry Lancaster-Goguen, Elias Pace, and their family and friends who participated. Looking good in those orange headbands!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[WASHINGTON DC—September 7, 2016—Dean Gaalaas joins MGAC as Chief Administrative Officer after a 23+ career in biotechnology. His most recent role was that of Chief Operating Officer for GeneDx, a molecular diagnostics laboratory with a focus on rare diseases and hereditary oncology. At GeneDx he was responsible for helping build the infrastructure and processes necessary for handling a three times increase in sample volume over three years. He earned his B.A. in Chemistry from Jacksonville University. Dean is a huge sports fan, particularly baseball, having played at the junior college level and coached at the youth level for the last five years.

"It is a very exciting time to join MGAC as the organization begins its next phase of growth. I am looking forward to inhabiting the newly created role of Chief Administrative Officer, and working with our staff to develop a platform for success that will allow MGAC to grow sustainably for the next 20 years and beyond while maintaining the culture and quality that is synonymous with the firm," said Dean.

"Dean brings to MGAC a successful career building business systems to sustain customer service. Coming from genetic molecular biotechnology and genetic sequencing businesses, he understands how to build repeatable processes to support better outcomes. As MGAC grows across the United States and overseas, Dean will help ensure the provision of quality business support processes to our client facing staff – whether financial information, human resources, communications, business development or technology support. Our clients will benefit through a higher level of best practices in our provision of service, as well as increased efficiency in our cost structure," said Mark Anderson, MGAC president and founder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[CLEVELAND–SEPTEMBER 21, 2016–The giant scissors are ready, and the red ribbon is waiting. On Wednesday, September 28, <a href="http://www.americangreetings.com/">American Greetings</a> will officially cut the ribbon at its brand-new Creative Studios at Crocker Park in Westlake, Ohio, capping off a labor of love nearly six years in the making. The 660,000-SF, five-story world headquarters for the family-owned and Cleveland-based business is so much more than an office – it’s truly a work of art. The American Greetings Creative Studios will help position the 110-year-old Company for continued growth and adaptation to changing industry needs while providing an environment that more effectively supports the Company’s creative and innovative culture.

“We are celebrating an incredibly significant time in American Greetings history,” said Jeff Weiss, Co-Chief Executive Officer, American Greetings. “Our Company purpose to make the world a more thoughtful and caring place is physically embodied throughout our new home, and, as the building itself was designed to maximize collaboration and creativity, we are forever grateful to the top-notch partners we collaborated with to turn this goal into a reality. The state-of-the-art facility represents a commitment to the future of the Company, to the social expressions industry, and to Northeast Ohio.”

The Creative Studios was designed by world-renowned architecture firm CallisonRTKL and brought to life by Walsh Construction as a part of Crocker Park, a Stark Enterprises development. Other valued partners include MGAC for project management and Bialosky + Partners for construction administration and design. The building boasts a modern, open floor plan; a unique and inspiring outdoor courtyard centrally located on the third floor; and a stunning interior masterfully curated with one-of-a-kind artwork of every medium that is almost-exclusively from American Greetings artists. The vibrant Crocker Park community and warm welcome from the city of Westlake have made the Company’s transition to the Creative Studios a smooth one.

“One of the world’s most consistently creative and forward-thinking enterprises has just lifted Crocker Park, Westlake and Northeast Ohio onto its shoulders,” said Robert Stark, President and Chief Executive Officer, Stark Enterprises. “Thank you, American Greetings, for leading us into the 21st Century with your confidence and your state-of-the-art workplace. It seamlessly melds with the contextual energy of Crocker Park, which is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life of all who partake in the experience that we are privileged to offer together.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is this the zombie apocalypse?

No, I am not talking about anything political, regardless of one’s political leanings. I was thinking about office space as an investment asset class. In the neighborhood surrounding our office there are the remnants of what once were considered “trophy” class A office buildings – largely constructed for an “anchor lease” which is usually a large law firm, but once upon a time they would include government agencies. Institutional owners would build these office buildings on the backs of their anchor lease, and essentially construct a 10- or 15-year fixed-income investment instrument, backed by the underlying asset value of real estate and a building.

But as happens in life, and in real estate, leases and buildings age. What was once the cool new thing is now yesterday’s news. Leases expire, and the underlying asset suddenly no longer seems as valuable. Again, our office neighborhood is filled with these examples.

This week I was talking with a venerated real estate leader, who revealed that over the last year, 60% of his activity for new clients has been for “loan servicing agents” on defaulted portfolios of office buildings. Then Wednesday morning I picked up the Wall Street Journal – page B1 – and there it is, “Defaults Rise in Key Sector of Real Estate.”

There is a confluence of negative factors coming together here. Corporate and government users are increasing office density, reducing their space demand. The growth of urban cities and the millennial, non-car-driven society has brought a world of pain to the typical suburban office park. High construction cost driven by a vibrant multi-family residential construction market drives higher class A lease rates, which compresses space and pushes tenants to B and C properties. Buildings aging into 10- and 15-year leases consummated before the Global Financial Crisis were frequently financed through ten year commercial mortgage-backed securitized loans. Those loans are now maturing. With vacancy in suburban and aging class A/becoming B properties increasing into the double digits. Consequently an inability to refinance, and subsequently and ultimately default.

Is this the zombie apocalypse for commercial office space? The signs are not good when one hears that 60% of the activity for a national real estate player is distressed property, but time will tell. Low interest rates have created the thirst for yield and safe homes for capital, driving valuations higher, and keeping the commercial office construction market busy, but I have to wonder if the repositioned B/C building class with their lower valuations and lower basis form a more interesting and potentially busy future market for design and construction services.

We will see as time passes. In the meantime there are armies of very bright young minds looking for double-digit returns for their hedge funds and real estate fund capital, and the design and construction industry will be pressed to provide services to meet their pro forma models.]]></content:encoded>

All proceeds from this lively evening of food and drink went to benefit MGAC's longtime philanthropic partner, <a href="https://www.calvaryservices.org/">Calvary Women’s Services</a>.

Calvary Women’s Services provides housing, health, education and employment programs for women who are homeless in DC. Every five days a woman moves from Calvary into her own home.

This evening of fun and networking was hosted by <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/heather-davis/13">Heather Davis</a>, MGAC's Director of Brand + Culture and Vice President of Calvary's Board of Directors, along with Colleen Wevodau, Senior Manager at Baker Tilly and Calvary Board Member, and Lisa Carter, Mid Atlantic Regional Manager at Kimball Office.

Thank you to everyone who joined us at the Kimball Office DC Showroom to network for a good cause - supporting women as they work to build stronger futures for themselves and their families.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend, after a multiyear process, American Geophysical Union received final approval from their Board of Directors to move forward with the groundbreaking net zero renovation of their Washington, DC headquarters building. Contractors will begin interior and exterior preparations in the next few weeks, and construction will begin in March 2017. AGU staff will be relocating to a new temporary home in the heart of downtown D.C. during the renovation process.

When complete, this project will become the first net zero renovation of a commercial office building in Washington, DC, serving as an example to encourage others to incorporate similar approaches and designs into new and existing facilities throughout the city. MGAC is serving as owner's representative for the project, in addition to providing project management, cost and risk management, procurement, and technology solutions services as a part of the integrated AGU project team.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color: #000000;">Being tasked with the selection and purchasing of furniture for your workplace can seem like a fun and exciting task.</span> Who wouldn't want to have a say in the look and feel of their office space? But oftentimes, what at first seemed like a simple assignment can turn into a complex and overwhelming experience – one that if handled incorrectly can end up costing your business time and money it can't afford to lose.

We sat down and talked with ReNae Mohr, Vice President and leader of MGAC's Procurement and Move Management teams, about the difference between shopping and procurement, the risks involved with these types of purchases, and the advice she gives clients on how to avoid them.
<h4>Many people have experience shopping for furniture, whether for their home or office. What makes procurement different from this type of shopping?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>ReNae:</strong></span> To me, shopping is more about purchasing commodity items. Things you buy off the shelf that are ready to go instead of being customized for your specific space or needs. Procurement allows you to be much more specialized and intentional in your purchasing. Instead of selecting items based purely on aesthetics, a procurement process provides the opportunity to assess a full scope of needs – from things as small as individual ergonomic settings to larger issues that provide additional value over time, such as user functionality and a product’s lifetime expectancy.

A lot of people working in smaller office environments might think, “I’m only making a small purchase, so I should just go through the Staples or Office Depot catalogue.” There is nothing wrong with this approach, and you may find furniture there that meets your needs – at least for as long as it lasts. What you won’t find there is the level of service and holistic thinking that a comprehensive procurement effort provides. Instead of just asking what and how many, the procurement process asks what do you want it to do, how do you want it to perform, and how long do you need it to last. That way what you end up purchasing is exactly what you want, and what you need to support your business requirements and overall workplace strategy.
<h4>Now I know I need to think about more than just "what" and "how many" when I’m making this kind of purchase. Can’t I just handle it myself?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>ReNae:</strong></span> Absolutely, but it’s risky, especially when ordering large quantities. The fact of the matter is that this isn’t a common task for most clients – compounded with the fact that these efforts are often assigned in addition to the responsibilities of their full time job. For procurement specialists, this is their full time job, and they handle similar orders every day for many different types of clients. They know what questions to ask and how to protect their clients’ needs, time, and investment.

One story that always comes to mind is a client who purchased five file cabinets for delivery. The vendor delivered all right, but they delivered five unassembled file cabinets that were left in their boxes in the hallway. These types of assumptions are where most non-experts dabbling in procurement make their biggest mistakes. It may seem like overkill to negotiate delivery, assembly, and trash disposal, but when overlooked these are the extra steps that can lead to lost time and money, damage to materials, and embarrassment due to lack of experience. And the impact of these mistakes can increase exponentially depending on the size of the order. Can you imagine how long it takes to assemble 100 workstations – correctly and in the exact right place – if you’ve never done it before?
<h4>What are some strategies that procurement specialists use to help clients avoid these types of oversights?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>ReNae:</strong></span> Aside from relying on general experience, there are multiple ways specialists ensure they’re avoiding critical oversights.
<h6>Issuing a Request for Proposals</h6>
Depending on the client or size of an order, they may choose to issue a Request for Proposal, or RFP, that outlines things like budget, schedule, requirements, and the scope of services required from the dealership. This allows the procurement team, and the client, to compare apples to apples on the things that are most important to them – and sets expectations upon which to negotiate the final deal and measure the success of the effort as a whole. Personally, I tend to avoid issuing a RFP unless I’m spending more than $50,000. Compiling a comprehensive RFP requires the investment of time and money by a client, and while it can be a crucial step for large-scale orders, it typically isn’t worth it for the smaller ones.
<h6>Relationship Development</h6>
There are a lot of furniture manufacturers out there to consider who offer a lot of similar products. Sometimes what can differentiate one red chair from the next isn’t the material used to construct it, but the person you’re buying it from. Procurement specialists have spent their careers developing relationships with manufacturers and know exactly who to go to get the best quality products at the best price for the best all-around experience. Factoring in a client’s specific needs and personality, they can help find a partner whose products and level of customer service exceeds expectations.
<h6>Scalable Services</h6>
Engaging a procurement specialist doesn’t always have to mean the same thing to every client. Depending on needs and budget, you can engage a specialist to assist with any number of procurement tasks – from simply reviewing a pre-developed approach and providing recommendations, to managing purchasing for a new 750,000-SF headquarters. It’s all about filling gaps and helping ensure that you get exactly what you want, exactly when you need it. So whether you feel like you need an extra set of eyes, or a champion to lead the way, all you need to do is ask.

While shopping can be fun, procurement is a whole different animal. Finding products that suit your aesthetic and functional desires, as well as your schedule and budget needs is time consuming and requires more than just an eye for design. Next time you’re in need of an office refresh or addition, consider seeking the advice and leadership of a <a href="https://www.mgac.com/contact/">procurement specialist</a> to give you the knowledge, service, and peace of mind you deserve.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Los Angeles Business Journal</span> has released its <a href="http://labusinessjournal.com/lalists/">2017 Book of Lists</a>, and it's looking like a big year for MGAC's Cost + Risk team. Two of the team's projects are among the top five of LABJ's Largest Construction Projects of 2017 list – with Wilshire Grand Center claiming the coveted top spot.

MGAC is providing cost and risk management, cost estimating, and change order evaluation services for the <a href="http://www.wilshiregrandcenter.com/">Wilshire Grand Center</a>, a $1 billion and 73-story mixed-use tower that recently earned itself the title of tallest building west of the Mississippi River. Upon completion later this year, the tower will combine 400,00 SF of Class 'A' office space, a 900-key hotel, and 45,100 SF of new restaurant and retail space.

Landing in the fifth spot is the 2.8 million-square-foot <a href="http://newcenturyplaza.com/">Century Plaza</a> development, which will feature two new 46-story luxury residential towers, restaurants, retail shops, and the renovation of the existing Century Plaza Hotel. MGAC is providing cost and risk management services for the development, including independent cost review for permit and bid packages.

See below for more recent coverage of these two highly anticipated additions to the Los Angeles skyline.

The Craftsmanship Awards Program was created "to honor those who individually provided exceptional workmanship on buildings throughout the Washington, DC area," and is "the only local organization that recognizes the skills of craftsmen" through this annual celebration.

MGAC's <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/kris-collins-/19">Kris Collins</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/greta-perry/11">Greta Perry</a>, and Matt Matese joined fellow expert evaluators to review 255 entries submitted this year across ten different categories. After being broken into 33 separate teams, the judges took on DC traffic to visit their designated sites throughout the city.

"This was my first time serving as judge for WBC. I signed up because I thought that it would be an interesting day seeing a variety of projects that I would not otherwise have the opportunity to see. It proved to be much more. My team looked at 7 projects, which were for everything from water features and staircases to scaffolding and hoists. Several of the nominating teams spoke passionately about the complexities of their projects and had great stories to tell. There were many projects I would love to have spent all day touring. I came away from the day's tour with a new enthusiasm for the dedicated craftsmanship that makes every project so unique and special." - Greta Perry, Vice President

"I'd heard that this was a great event that fills up fast, and I made sure to sign up early. After today's experience, I will absolutely be doing the same next year. I found it challenging to pick 'winners' since every single one of the projects was impressive in its own regard. What most struck me throughout the experience was the complexities of the projects, along with the pride that the GC’s had in their tradesmen. It was a great networking event and a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get behind the scenes at some of DC's landmark projects." - Matt Matese, Project Manager

Good luck to everyone who submitted to this year's awards and thank you to WBC for such an amazing day. Join us on Friday, March 31st at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for the <a href="http://www.wbcnet.org/craftsmanship-awards/awards-banquet-registration/">61st Annual Craftsmanship Awards Banquet</a> where 2017 project and individual winners will be announced.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Taking on a new design and construction project comes with a lot of risk. Aside from the time and money required, no two design and construction projects are exactly alike, and there is a tremendous learning curve associated with becoming fluent in the process, players, and terminology involved in transforming an idea into a built reality. So how as an owner, even one with experience, can you overcome these challenges to ensure your vision is realized? One way to reduce risk is to find a partner, or an owner's representative, with the experience and expertise to guide you through the process. But what is their role, and how do you know if hiring an owner's rep is right for you and your project?

We asked MGAC Managing Director, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O'Connor</a>, to explain what an owner's representative actually is, why and when they're needed, and how hiring one can mean the difference between success and struggle for your project.
<h4>What is an owner's rep, and what do they do?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>Ashley: </strong></span>In my experience, an owner's rep is someone hired by an owner to manage and execute a design and construction project on their behalf – particularly when they don't have the industry knowledge, time or resources in-house to do it themselves. An owner's rep acts as the owner's eyes and ears throughout the entire process with the sole purpose of executing their goals and mission. As we like to say here at MGAC, an owner should be able to say to their rep, "go be me," and have the confidence and trust that the rep will do just that.

Ideally, an owner's rep is engaged at the very beginning of the process. This way they're able to work alongside the owner to identify budget and project objectives, a realistic schedule based on the project's goals, and a clear understanding of what success looks like to them. Once these fundamental pieces are in place, the rep can then help identify and assemble the ideal team of design, construction, and specialty consultants to deliver on the clients goals. From that point forward, it's about management, communication, and coordination. I like to think of an owner's rep like a conductor in an orchestra. Someone has to take all of these brilliant, creative artists, and plan for how they're all going to work together, in the right sequence, to create something beautiful. Instead of sheet music and instruments, it's structuring scopes of work and schedules to align to a master plan for the project – making sure everything is moving exactly when it needs to move, and costing exactly what it's supposed to cost.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1288" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OwnersRep_QUOTE-1.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="696" />
<h4>What challenges are clients who hire an owner's rep typically facing?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>Ashley: </strong></span>Every owner’s challenges are different based on their specific needs, their familiarity with design and construction, and what they do and don't know about the process. The reality is, whether they're the CEO, the COO, or someone who has been tasked to lead the project internally, they're all challenged with balancing their new project responsibilities with their day job – a job which may even be on the line based on the success of the project.

In an ideal world, the owner's rep is brought in early so they can weigh in as a subject matter expert on potential project pitfalls from the beginning, and use their experience to help steer the owner to success. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, and oftentimes owners are seeking support from an owner's rep after the project is already underway. In my experience, this is caused by one of four reasons:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>They're overwhelmed:</strong> All the sudden they realize they aren't able to get their day jobs done, or they are not as comfortable with the process as they originally thought. They're being inundated with change orders and requests and they're unable, or don't have time, to answer all of the different questions coming in from their consultant team. They are becoming a bottleneck in both the project and their day job and need help to keep both moving. Without this help, they won't be able to make timely decisions and the project will likely fall behind schedule, if it isn't already.</li>
 	<li><strong>They encounter mistakes (i.e. they don’t know what they don’t know):</strong> Maybe they didn't know they needed to hire a permit expeditor, or they realize that none of the design consultants own the responsibility of consolidating the drawings into a final bid set. A key component of their project unintentionally slipped through the cracks because they didn't buy it right and now they have to figure out how to correct their mistake, which will take time and add cost to the budget.</li>
 	<li><strong>They're behind schedule:</strong> Keeping a project team on schedule is complicated - and every additional day has an impact on budget. Sometimes an overwhelmed owner may not even realize when or why delays have happened. They need someone to help identify issues, reestablish critical milestones, and get the project back on track.</li>
 	<li><strong>They need back up:</strong> Sometimes an owner's rep is hired to explain controversial or complex issues to key leadership that internal staff may not have the experience or background to do. Plus, the owner's rep can handle conflict resolution so the client doesn't have to take on that role. Whether it's dealing with cost overruns or difficult personalities, the owner's rep can stay impartial and out in front of issues - developing strategic solutions to resolve them before they impact the project.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How can hiring an owner's rep positively impact your project?</h4>
<span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>Ashley: </strong></span>Well, like most things, it all comes down to managing resources, time, and money. Having an owner's rep allows an owner to appropriately invest their time in connection to the project in a way they can manage because it's been laid out for them. And as I've said, the earlier an owner's rep gets involved, the more value they can bring to the project - hiring the right team and setting a project up for success. By the time a project reaches construction, an owner's rep has the cost estimates to establish a realistic and accurate budget, has hired the right contractor to ensure it stays on schedule, and has documented every step of the way to guarantee the project meets established goals. In the end, it's about providing the owner with peace of mind and a final result that's exactly what they envisioned.

MGAC served as exhibit coordinator to the museum’s exhibit fabricator, <a href="http://www.d-and-p.com/">Design and Production Incorporated</a> – helping manage and deliver the 12 inaugural exhibits across the museum’s 85,000 SF of exhibit space.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our Missions Made Real mantra is about more than just our clients. We pride ourselves on applying the same level of passion, dedication, and support to helping everyone here at MGAC realize their own personal career missions, too. That's why we're excited to introduce <em>On a Mission</em> – a new blog series for Better Outcomes focused on shining a light on our employees, and sharing stories from their own personal journey to a mission made real. This month, we spoke with Alyssa Stipcak about her role as an Assistant Project Manager, and how taking advantage of professional development opportunities has helped further both her and her clients' goals.
<h4>How would you describe the role of an Assistant Project Manager?</h4>
I think it depends on the level of expertise that an individual has coming into the role. I started in an entry level position, so for me it's about assisting the lead project managers in order to help make their lives easier. Most of the time that involves observation, facilitation, and coordination efforts, but my responsibilities have evolved over the past couple of months as I've gotten more familiar with the projects I've been assigned.

Meeting minutes, monthly reporting, budget tracking, and coordination efforts are some of my main responsibilities – tracking everything that goes on so that we have a reference point I've also gradually become more involved in coordinating efforts on site with contractors and sub-contractors, as well as assisting with invoices and billing processes.
<h4>What is the most important skill set you need to be successful as an APM?</h4>
Organization – and I think that extends to project managers and senior project managers as well. Being a project manager is exactly what it sounds like. You are responsible for overseeing a lot of different roles, including supporting team members who are working in the field. Being able to support everyone with what they need when they need it requires you to be aware of everything that's going on across the breadth of the project.
<h4>How are you interacting with clients, and how has that changed over time?</h4>
I've gradually been getting more involved as I become more knowledgeable and more familiar with my projects. At the beginning it was all about listening, just soaking everything in, and taking mental notes. I'm still doing that, but I'm beginning to make more direct contributions. I'll pick up on things and can vocalize them now, where I might not have done that a few months ago. I think that is something I'll continue to improve upon. That's a goal that I have for myself – to continue to be more vocal – but I think that comes with experience. As I learn more, I'll be able to give more input.
<h4>What's the biggest challenge you've had to overcome?</h4>
My biggest challenges have been getting more comfortable in my role and familiarizing myself with the nuances of the construction industry. Every building is different, every project is different, the industry is constantly changing and evolving, and there's an unlimited amount of knowledge I need to pick up on. I took a class last fall to help myself acclimate more quickly, but learning to speak to everything involved in the construction of a project will be a continuous learning process.

That being said, the fact that I've continued to make progress and grow my responsibilities over time has been my biggest win so far. I can see my progress and I hope the project managers and clients I support can see it as well. I feel more confident speaking to my projects than I did nine months ago, and have been able to implement the things that I've learned – and obviously that’s something that I hope to continue to improve upon over time.
<h4>What role has mentorship played in your ability to grow as an APM?</h4>
I've had a great experience with the two project managers I'm working with – <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mimi-toner/32">Mimi Toner</a> and Walt Layton. The projects we've been working on have provided a great mentoring environment because there is so much going on across the campus.

I've gotten to see projects of all sorts, and Mimi and Walt both have a ton of experience and expertise to share. Shadowing them has been great, and they've allowed me the opportunity to take on more responsibility as I've gained a better understanding of the various projects. The best thing about their partnership is that they have two different management styles and approaches to mentoring – which is great for me. Walt is always in the field, very hands on, and has a strong construction background. Mimi’s project has been in the design phases so she is not in the field as much right now, but her ability to stay organized and manage timelines has been vital in coordinating efforts with the client and contractors in her current behind-the-scenes kind of role. They are a good complement to one another and they are both really good at what they do. It's been great to have them both as mentors, and I've been kind of spoiled in that regard.
<h4>What advice would you give someone joining MGAC as an APM?</h4>
My biggest piece of advice would be to ask questions and take full advantage of every learning opportunity, whether that's mentorship or more formal professional development. For me this meant participating in courses offered through MGAC University, like Microsoft Project tutorials, as well as taking advantage of the professional development support MGAC offers by signing up for a supplementary architecture class and attending networking events. Investing in myself has helped me with the onboarding process on different projects and has allowed me to provide more value. If you do that, I think MGAC provides a great platform for young professionals, like myself, to make their career whatever they want it to be. Whether it's expanding horizontally across market sectors or hopefully climbing vertically to a Project Manager position sometime in the future, I feel like I can grow how I want as long as I take advantage of the resources provided to me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever felt that managing your project would be so much easier if everyone involved could just read your mind? If they knew exactly what you wanted, how you wanted it, and when without having to repeat the same conversations over and over again?

Unfortunately, your project team members are not mind readers, and expecting them to be puts the entire team at risk of making mistakes that can negatively impact the progress, quality, and cost of your project. One way to avoid these risks – and set your team and project up for success – is to establish clear expectations up front, and communicate them in a transparent and consistent way from start to finish. This alignment not only creates peace of mind for you as an owner, but ensures everyone on your team know exactly what they are working towards, why it's important, and their role in making it happen.

To help, we asked MGAC Senior Project Manager, Ted Silence, to share his favorite tools and strategies for getting your entire project team on the same page – and keeping them there.
<h4>How are expectations established at the beginning of a project to ensure everyone is on the same page?</h4>
First, every single consultant has a contract that defines their individual role, timeline, and deliverables for the project. These contracts set a baseline of understanding for each individual participant, but as we all know, the success of a project hinges on collaboration, communication, and coordination among all parties involved.

To achieve a shared understanding, oftentimes an owner will conduct a partnering session at the outset of their project. In these sessions everyone comes together to discuss common goals and how the team will work together. The result of these conversations are documented in what we call a team charter – or a formalized document that outlines agreed upon goals and processes, and serves as a behavioral guide for the team throughout the life of the project. Some things that may be included in a charter include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>WHO:</strong> Outline of project stakeholders, identification of core team members</li>
 	<li><strong>WHAT:</strong> Project name, outline of key deliverables, project assumptions, project constraints, sustainability targets</li>
 	<li><strong>WHERE:</strong> Project location</li>
 	<li><strong>WHEN: </strong>Project timeline - including actions, milestones, and associated due dates</li>
 	<li><strong>WHY:</strong> Business case, project goals and objectives</li>
 	<li><strong>HOW:</strong> Project budget and financials, risk planning, rules of engagement, team culture, RFI response timeframes and guidelines, review and approval timeframes for pay applications and change orders</li>
</ul>
Once the charter is developed, the entire team signs it and puts it up on the wall in their individual office space. It serves as a constant reminder of what the team is working towards, and a reference to the mutual agreements established by the team at the beginning of the project.
<h4>Are there other tools, similar to the charter, that you've found useful in setting expectations upfront?</h4>
I've used a variety of different tools during my time as an owner's rep, and recommend that every team choose what's right for them based on the size and complexity of both the team and the project itself. Some tools that can be used to supplement the team charter include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Communication Management Plan:</strong> This plan outlines the different ways a team communicates. Typically, the plan includes the identification of all regular meetings and reports and defines the communication type, the objective of the communication, the medium, the frequency, the audience, the owner, and any deliverables that may come as a result of that communication.</li>
 	<li><strong>Communication Matrix: </strong>This matrix lists all of the project partners and identifies what information goes to whom. This helps make sure team members are receiving any and all information relevant to their role, and no key stakeholders are left off of crucial communications.</li>
 	<li><strong>RACI Chart: </strong>A RACI Chart is a matrix that sets all project activities or goals against key stakeholders and team members. Each intersection identifies the individual or team's stake of ownership in the result of the activity or goal based on one of four categories: Responsible (<em>who is assigned to do the work</em>), Accountable (<em>who makes the final decision and has ultimate ownership</em>), Consulted (<em>who is consulted before a decision is made</em>), or Informed (<em>who must be informed that a decision was made</em>).</li>
 	<li><strong>Project Directory: </strong>The project directory lists every single person on the project - including their title, company, phone number, and email. It sounds simple, but it's a very useful tool that helps people know who to call when there is a problem. It is especially useful on longer projects where there might be turnover within large teams.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do you monitor whether expectations are being met throughout the life of a project?</h4>
A big part of what we do as owner's reps is document everything to cover everyone legally. If there are issues down the road with delays or cost impacts, we need to know how we got there. That's where meeting minutes, schedule updates, and monthly status reports help to tell a story and explain what happened.

One of the most important ways for a team to communicate is by having regular meetings. No one likes to have a lot of meetings because they're time consuming, but they're also necessary to keep people informed and facilitate timely decision making. It's important to send out agendas beforehand so that people know what's expected of them, and to get feedback from the team about what needs to be on the agenda so that everybody can be as useful as possible in the time allotted. Then, after the meeting, it's critical that meeting minutes with identified action items are sent within 48 hours. These are important communication tools that not only outline what needs to be done, but they also document where the team is each week, and when and where issues are occurring.

As owner's reps, we also share monthly updates with the client that include a schedule update, identification of schedule risks, a budget update with construction costs and consultant costs, a risk matrix, and the potential outcome of the project. Basically, it's a snapshot in time that allows us to track whether expectations are being met, and address issues as they occur - and before they turn into larger problems.
<h4>How do clearly defined and mutually agreed upon expectations benefit a project in the long run?</h4>
Clearly defined and consistently managed expectations are essential to achieving a project's goals, but they also have an enormous impact on the overall project experience for everyone involved. I've witnessed firsthand how clarity of roles and responsibilities, processes, and team culture can inspire an increased dedication to the project, team, and client. When people feel a part of something bigger, they're always willing to go the extra mile to see it realized.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re back with the second installment of our new On a Mission blog series – shining a light on our employees, and sharing stories from their own personal journey to a mission made real. Over the next few weeks we’ll hear from a team of interns from <a href="http://architecture.cua.edu/">Catholic University of America’s School of Architecture and Planning</a> (CUA) who’ve spent the past seven months working with us in support of <a href="http://building.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union’s net-zero headquarters renovation project</a> which is currently under construction.

This week we spoke to Kelly Reed about her time with MGAC, finding her own unique career path within the industry, and what it’s been like to participate in such a ground-breaking project.
<h4>What attracted you to this particular internship opportunity?</h4>
At the Catholic University, sustainability is something that we value highly. So when I heard about this opportunity to secure an internship working on a net-zero project in the DC area, it seemed like the perfect fit. I was also intrigued by the fact that MGAC is not an architecture firm. I had worked at an architecture firm at a previous internship, and found the opportunity to work within and experience a different side of the building industry very interesting.

Over the past few months I have helped to compile a reuse plan for the building – tracking chairs, tables, glass panels, and even doors in an effort to make sure anything that could be diverted away from a landfill was.  In addition, David and I found donation partners so that anything we couldn’t repurpose in the building could be put to use elsewhere in the community. This work as interns, although relatively small compared to the overall scope of the project, was still treated in high regard by the entire team. To me, this shows the commitment AGU has to sustainability and how they have surrounded themselves with a design, construction, and management team with a similar mindset.
<h4>As an architect in training, what did you get out of interning with the project's owner's representative?</h4>
In school we do a lot of design work. Most people get it in their mind that you have to design, get your license, and then work in a regular architecture firm after graduation. The designing aspect of architecture has never interested me as much as the construction part. It was refreshing to see what else I could do with an architecture degree besides design, and this experience opened my eyes to a lot of new possibilities for my career.
<h4>What is one of your favorite memories from your internship experience?</h4>
In November, I had the privilege to stand alongside the AGU design team and present AGU’s building renovation project to my peers, as well as my faculty at The Catholic University of America’s School of Architecture and Planning. David and I were brought onto the team by MGAC at the beginning of September in order to help facilitate some of the reuse tracking and donation strategies for the project, as well as look into some possible funding opportunities. The idea soon surfaced that we should find a way to engage Catholic University's architectural community in the project in the hopes that students will take the mission of sustainable design with them throughout their schooling and their careers, and we were invited to join the AGU team in a presentation to the school.

Representatives from the project's key partners – MGAC, <a href="http://www.hickokcole.com/">Hickok Cole</a>, <a href="http://www.skanska.com/">Skanska</a>, and <a href="http://www.interfaceengineering.com/">Interface Engineering</a> – each provided an overview about their role in the project within the context of AGU's larger goals, and David and I shared about the importance of reuse to a sustainable building renovation. I think seeing this spoke to the value Catholic University places on sustainable design and engaging sustainability in every manner possible, no matter how small – a value CUA and AGU have in common. It was a great feeling showing others what I have learned and been a part of, and hopefully we've given our peers some ideas for their future work in regards to sustainability.
<h4>What was the most valuable takeaway from your time with MGAC and the AGU team?</h4>
I think the most valuable thing I learned is that if you want to be the first to do something and you want to set an new standard for sustainability, it needs to be a team effort. The architect, the engineer, the owner, the owners rep, and whoever else is working on the project have to work together and understand the ultimate goal for the project. Yes, there will be some heated meetings from time to time, and people may disagree, but I learned that in order to be successful, the team must keep in mind the project's aims in its entirety and not just focus on their own individual roles.
<h4>What is one piece of advice that you would give to fellow students as they begin seeking their own internships?</h4>
I would advise future students to give every opportunity that comes there way a chance. I am glad I got the chance to work in an office that was not strictly an architecture firm because it gave me the opportunity to explore the many different career possibilities available to someone with an architecture degree.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our On a Mission series continues with MGAC intern and <a href="http://architecture.cua.edu/">Catholic University of America’s School of Architecture and Planning</a> (CUA) student, Michael Spinelli, who’s spent the past seven months working with us in support of <a href="http://building.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union’s net-zero headquarters renovation project</a>.

We caught up with Michael about his time with MGAC, his memorable first day on the job, and what the lessons he learned about teamwork as a part of the highly-collaborative AGU team.
<h4>What attracted you to this particular internship opportunity?</h4>
As a student at Catholic University, we're taught a lot about what sustainability means and how to design sustainably. Catholic does an excellent job with their curriculum to ensure that we are well versed in these topics, but when I heard about this opportunity to intern at MGAC and work on the AGU project, I knew this would be a great chance to expand my interest in sustainable design by applying it to the profession, not just the classroom.
<h4>As an architect in training, what did you get out of interning with the project's owner's representative?</h4>
As an architecture student, I found it extremely valuable to partake in a project from the owner’s representative side. In school, we're taught to design and design with purpose, which is important for architects. We also learn that we're supposed to design spaces based on the needs and wants of the owner. Well, this semester I learned how the client determines their needs, and the difference it can make when it comes to designing a space for the users, not just the architect.
<h4>What is one of your favorite memories from your internship experience?</h4>
My favorite memory was on my first day. Greta Perry invited me to attend an onsite meeting between <a href="https://sites.agu.org/">AGU</a>, MGAC, <a href="http://www.hickokcole.com/">Hickok Cole</a>, <a href="http://www.usa.skanska.com/">Skanska</a>, and <a href="http://www.interfaceengineering.com/">Interface</a>. When we arrived, I did what any intern would do and took a seat in the back of the conference room. Greta immediately invited me to sit at the table and partake in the meeting instead. Also, at the end of the meeting, the team was willing to listen to any questions or comments that I had. It made me feel like a valued member of the design team, and confirmed that this internship wasn't going to be just about making copies, but that I was going to be a part of a team that made a major impact in the field of design and construction. This became even more apparent when later in the semester I joined fellow intern, David Niven, to give brief presentations to each of the team members on research we conducted on how to improve the building's Integrated Building Technology. The importance of this research on the final result proved to me that I was truly a valued team member on this project - and for that, I will always be grateful to MGAC and the AGU team.
<h4>What was the most valuable takeaway from your time with MGAC and the AGU team?</h4>
For me the most valuable takeaway has been seeing what can be achieved when everyone is working as a team. In school, I've always heard how important working together is to achieving a design goal, and the impact it can have on the design, the profession, and for the users. I've only partially seen this in my previous work experience, as some parties try to work together while others decide to be more selfish and only try to benefit themselves during the project. Not only did working with the AGU team show me how valuable team collaboration can be, it also taught me never to settle when setting my goals. As a student about to enter graduate school, I now know that if I truly want to achieve something, I need to go for it and do it because it’s possible.
<h4>What is one piece of advice that you would give to fellow students as they begin seeking their own internships?</h4>
One piece of advice I would give to any student looking for an internship is to ask questions and try to get involved. Going into my internship at MGAC I had never worked for an owner’s rep, nor had I ever been involved on such a large-scale renovation project determined to make this type of impact on the community and environment. However, I knew this was a great chance to learn so I asked questions when I had the opportunity. This way I not only gained knowledge, but can now take this knowledge to share with others, and have the chance to apply it in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the latest newsletter of BICSI Insider, MGAC’s Gerry Ward explains the importance of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). While officially considered the third line of defense by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), PPE is a mandatory first line of protection on any construction site. A lot of common mistakes occur during the hot summer months, but it’s easy to meet the OSHA requirements when you have the right equipment – and wear it properly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/kris-collins-/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Collins</a> has developed and presented at numerous workshops intended to provide Owners with insight into their <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/cultural/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">museum</a> development or renovation projects. This past month, he was invited to “Ready-Aim-Build”, an interactive session by Sino-American Arts Administration and Public Education in Hangzhou, China.

The two-day workshop was hosted by the <a href="http://en.caa.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China Academy of Art</a> and attended by <a href="http://www.smithgroupjjr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmithGroup JJR</a>, <a href="http://gallagherdesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallagher &amp; Associates</a>, and directors from six major Chinese museums. This meeting was a unique sharing of cultural insights into how to better develop and manage museum projects. China has become known for their process of hiring internationally recognized architects to develop drawings to Design Development (~50% complete), and then engaging local architects to complete the drawings and detailing through the Local Design Institute (LDI).

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1505" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0186.jpg" alt="" width="7559" height="3377" />Following the workshop in Hangzhou, the team was welcomed at the <a href="http://www.lumei.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LuXun Academy of Fine Arts</a>. The Academy is moving from downtown Shenyang to a new campus and museum in the suburbs - designed by Mario Botta. The American team was treated to a behind the scenes visit of a major museum collection, including cultural artifacts and artwork up to 6,000 years old.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1506" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0170.jpg" alt="" width="3622" height="3024" /><em><span style="color: #000000;">"I was humbled to be invited to take part in this workshop and to share my experiences with the museum community. It was an incredible opportunity to learn more about the rich Chinese culture, art, and history. Hearing from local museum directors gave me additional insight into how the development of museums are handled by government organizations external to these cultural institutions. It was fascinating to hear how they interact with their projects and the many complicated and unique challenges they face. For example, managing internal design teams and the language barriers for technical drawings. The Chinese directors were very interested in how Americans manage the design, planning, and operation of a new museum." - <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/kris-collins-/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris Collins</a></span>, MGAC</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS</strong>

From Q1 to the end of Q3 2017, MGAC recorded 100+ hotel developments in the pipeline (proposed/planned/under construction), among which approximately 60% are ground-up developments and 40% are renovations. These projects represent a total of more than 24,000 hotel rooms.
<ul>
 	<li>In Q3, California, Florida, and North Carolina represented the lion's share of all the ground-up hotel developments in the pipeline.</li>
 	<li>Upscale hotel chains were the most popular choice by owners for both new developments and renovations in Q3.</li>
</ul>
<strong>HOTEL TRANSACTIONS</strong>

In Q3 2017, MGAC tracked 50+ single-asset hotel transactions. These transactions totaled over $3.5 billion, representing approximately 16,000 hotel rooms with an average price per key of $240,000.
<ul>
 	<li>Some of the largest deals in terms of overall transaction amount include the MGM National Harbor Casino ($1.2 billion) in Maryland, the uncompleted Fontainebleau Resort in Las Vegas ($600 million), and the Oceans Edge Key West Hotel &amp; Marina ($175 million).</li>
 	<li>With 13% of major Q3 hotel transactions located within its borders, Florida was the most popular market for hotel investment, followed by California and Nevada with shares of 11% and 7%, respectively.</li>
</ul>
Explore the following interactive maps for all the hotel developments and transactions that took place in Q3 2017.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As project schedules get more compressed, I am increasingly seeing projects that must start construction BEFORE the contract is fully executed by utilizing either a Letter of Intent (LOI) or a Notice to Proceed (NTP). The value and scope of the construction work, authorized under a LOI or NTP, can range from a fraction of the total project cost, to as much as 100% of the full contract amount.

In many situations, despite having a certificate of insurance in place prior to the General Contractor commencing work on the property, insurance coverage only comes into effect when the contract is executed. This means that if any work is authorized to begin prior to the full execution of the contract, the owner and other involved parties could potentially be exposed to liability.

To avoid any potential gaps in coverage during this phase, it is imperative that the owner ensure that the NTP or LOI:
<ul>
 	<li>Are reviewed, in conjunction with the General Contractor's insurance policies, by their legal and insurance representatives</li>
 	<li>References or reiterates the owner’s “Insurance Requirements” clause from the contract.</li>
</ul>
In addition to full insurance coverage, the best policy for minimizing risk exposure is to have solid project management processes in place including smarter labor management, sequencing, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/how-do-i-set-and-manage-clear-expectations-for-my-project-team/">team coordination</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our Cost + Risk team has been providing cost management services on a new planned civic building in San Antonio, Texas since 2014. Between then and June 2017, we worked with the owner and design team to refine the project scope and create a design concept that aligned with the estimated cost of construction.

When Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas Gulf Coast in August this year, the owner was understandably concerned with how the bidding climate in the already saturated market would be affected. Our team was tasked with analyzing the potential impact it would have on construction costs in the San Antonio/Austin region, and specifically what the likely impact would be on their project at its time of bid, which is planned for early 2018.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1740 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MGAC-Hurricane-Harvey-Affected-Counties-Texas-Map-2.jpg" alt="MGAC Hurricane Harvey Construction Cost Impact Texas San Antonio Austin Hurricane Irma" width="1262" height="936" />
<h4><strong>Our Methodology</strong></h4>
Because the hurricane is such a recent event, few indices have released data to account for the impact of the disaster. In order to assess the cost impact of the hurricane with limited data availability, we interviewed local general contractors, subcontractors, vendors, labor unions, and the AGC to gain directional insights into the construction market over the next 18 months. This has helped us identify specific labor and material issues and risks across all major trades.

We also studied the case of Hurricane Katrina as a benchmark to gauge the potential magnitude of cost impact. Katrina is a relevant comparable for our analysis because preliminary estimates suggest that the economic impact Harvey has caused is second only to Katrina, with the potential to exceed it. Hurricane Katrina also shares another similarity with Harvey, having made its landfall in a region that had a robust and expanding construction market, much like current conditions in South Texas.
<h4><strong>Our Findings</strong></h4>
Rebuilding work following a natural disaster typically lags by a period of time due to the process of removing of damaged property, general clean-up, processing of insurance claims, return of evacuated people, and the mobilization time required for the construction industry to adjust to the sudden increase in work volume. Harvey is expected to begin influencing construction starts in the region beginning in early 2018 and progressing through 2019.

The demand for skilled labor in general and certain materials will increase because of the numerous competing needs throughout the region. The San Antonio region for instance, is currently experiencing a construction boom across the residential, commercial, and public sectors. In San Antonio alone, we are tracking nine major private developments in the pipeline, each with an estimated cost above $50 million, in addition to a number of public projects worth several billion already well underway.

Specifically, our research found that these factors are likely to result in:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Potential Labor Cost Increase of 10%:</strong> Labor shortage has been an ongoing issue across Texas, and is likely to be exacerbated by Hurricane Harvey. The upsurge in demand around the Houston area is expected to push up local labor prices, drawing the workforce from surrounding areas including Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth - which may cause price increases in these markets. Such workforce migration is already happening according to our interviews with local contractors. Data from Hurricane Katrina showed a similar trend, with an average labor cost increase of 10% in three metro areas surrounding New Orleans 1.5 years after the storm.</li>
 	<li><strong>Material Cost Increases For Specific Materials:</strong> Although the hurricane will affect the construction materials market in general, most of the rebuilding work will occur in the residential and commercial sectors. This is expected to primarily impact the cost of materials like lumber, plywood, sheathing, gypsum wallboard, plastics, and copper.</li>
 	<li><strong>Risk of Non-Competitive Bidding:</strong> In a busy market with abundant work but limited resources, there is always the risk that bids will be higher than expected because reduced competition among bidders allows contractors to charge a higher premium. A study has found that after Hurricane Katrina, the statewide bid index for federal highway projects jumped by 24% within 3 quarters following the storm, and then stabilized. In addition, the average number of bidders per project declined from 3.5 to 3, potentially due to the increased volume in repair projects necessitated by the storm. Because the market is already struggling to provide enough skilled labor to meet the existing demand, we believe that there may be a risk of non-competitive bidding on multiple trades in 2018–2019, the time when the greatest surge in rebuilding activity is expected.</li>
</ul>
The following table summarizes the interview sentiments of local contractors in San Antonio by each major trade:

</tbody>
</table>
<h4><strong>Our Recommendations</strong></h4>
We recommend that our clients take certain measures to prepare for these factors and develop a mitigation plan where possible. We suggest the following potential action items:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Track General Contractor and Subcontractor Interest Early:</strong> Conduct market outreach to gauge the likely level of interest among general contractors and subcontractors within the major trades 3-6 months prior to bidding.</li>
 	<li><strong>Identify Similar Competing Projects: </strong>Understand which major projects within the local and regional markets are likely to be bidding at the same time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Structure Flexible Bid Packages:</strong> Prepare possible additive or deductive bid alternates that can be implemented should bids come in higher than expected.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reserve A Sufficient Bidding Contingency: </strong>Allot a possible bidding contingency built into the estimated construction cost (ECC) and/or estimated total project cost (ETPC).</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Ongoing Research</strong></h4>
These types of events can impact the construction industry abruptly and unpredictably, particularly when the market is in an accelerated mode. We’ve learned from Hurricane Katrina that most of the impacts will be felt within the first 18 months following a natural disaster, and so are continuing to track Harvey’s effects through ongoing outreach to the local contracting community.

In addition, we have been monitoring the recent wildfires in California and Hurricane Irma to gauge their impact in California and Florida, as well as understand how they may impact the national construction industry. Regular updates will be provided as further data is gathered and analyzed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven’t seen a construction boom of this scale in Washington DC since the mid-nineties. These days, it seems that you can’t walk a block without passing a construction site or seeing a few cranes on the skyline.

And the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Last year, the number of construction permits issued in the District reached a five-year record high of 16,500. As of October 2017, over 15,200 construction permits have already been issued. At this pace, the total number of permits issued by the end of 2017 is likely to exceed last year.

These construction permits include over 30 major commercial and residential developments within the District, each valued at over $100 million, and with a combined total worth over $9 billion in construction value.

Needless to say, these developments are creating some challenges for our hospitality clients when obtaining entitlements and permits, and getting competitive bids.

[caption id="attachment_1890" align="aligncenter" width="820"]<img class="wp-image-1890" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LEnfant-Plaza-Hotel-Washington-DC-MGAC-Mapquest-1.png" alt="L'Enfant Plaza Hotel DC MGAC" width="820" height="559" /> <em>L’Enfant Plaza Hotel, a project we are currently managing for a client, is one of the many major developments currently underway in Washington DC. </em>Source: Mapquest[/caption]
<h4><strong>A Booming Construction Market &amp; Competitive Hospitality Sector</strong></h4>
Although much of the new construction is in the mixed-use, office, and residential sectors, hotel supply has also grown considerably. This is largely because of conventions/events and tourism growth, as well as the planned rise of the federal per diem rate in 2018. DC currently <a href="http://www.cvent.com/en/company/cvent-reveals-2017-list-of-top-meeting-destinations-in-us-emea-apac.shtml">ranks sixth</a> in the nation for events, ahead of significantly larger cities like Nashville, Dallas, and New York.

Recent hotel developments have <a href="http://wdcep.com/resource/dc-development-report/">added over 3,000 rooms </a>to the market from 2016 to 1H 2017, a 10% increase of the district’s total number of rooms. Our group has tracked more than 4,000 rooms that are currently at various stages in the pipeline, including over 900 rooms scheduled to enter the market by the end of 2017, 900 by 2018, and 700 by 2019.

In short, there is an urgent shortage of qualified hotel general contractors and specialty subcontractors available to handle the current pipeline.

<em>The 29 major hotel projects in Washington DC. Gray denotes recently completed projects; Blue shows projects currently in the pipeline. </em>

With the number of new rooms coming into the market, we’re seeing fewer hotel transactions in 2017. Many of our clients are cautious in pursuing assets in the market because of high acquisition costs and limited RevPAR growth prospects. Several major hospitality REITs with properties in Washington DC have expressed their market outlook:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://ir.hosthotels.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=60734&amp;p=quarterlyearnings"><strong>Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</strong></a> - “<em>We expect growth for the second half of 2017; however, we anticipate that the rate of growth will decelerate.</em>”</li>
 	<li><a href="https://sunstonehotelinvestorsinc.gcs-web.com/investor-overview"><strong>Sunstone Hotel Investors</strong></a> – “<em>...some markets may experience new hotel room openings at or greater than historic levels, including in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC where there are currently higher-than-average supplies of new hotel room openings.</em>”</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.bisnow.com/washington-dc/news/hotel/thayer-lodging-president-sees-hospitality-slow-down-says-worst-is-yet-to-come-78059?utm_source=CopyShare&amp;utm_medium=Browser"><strong>Thayer Lodging</strong></a> -  According to President Bruce Wiles, the city’s performance next year is expected to go down with nearly 700 rooms scheduled this Fall at the Wharf and other properties to be delivered in the suburbs and downtown.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How We're Advising Our Hotel Clients</strong></h4>
In response to these challenges, we have looked for ways to gain cost and schedule certainty while maintaining a competitive general contractor (GC) selection process. As a firm, we have developed GC procurement alternatives to the traditional competitive lump sum bid method.

One approach we have proposed to our clients is to request that GCs provide a full cost estimate, project schedule, general conditions, and fee at an early Design Development milestone. The cost estimate and project schedule are for informational purposes only at this stage, but serves to help us better understand each proposing GCs’ knowledge, creativity, and competitiveness. The general conditions and fee of the selected GC are then locked in as a competitive hard bid.

Through the development of the design and construction documents, the selected GC and its key subcontractors will have the opportunity to provide preconstruction services including cost management, scheduling, constructability, and design input. Involving the GC during these phases (especially construction document development) can help optimize the design and minimize future surprises.

Only at an established milestone (typically 50%, 90%, or 100% construction documents), will the GC produce a GMP. If this final price falls outside of the owner’s budget, the owner reserves the option to re-bid the project with other GCs.

In addition, we are leveraging our 20+ year relationship with DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) and other agencies involved in the entitlement and permitting process to move projects through these burdened agencies. Our clients would also benefit from our connections with the most knowledgeable legal, zoning, and expediting consultants in the region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve spent more than three decades designing and managing the development of high-rise commercial buildings across the U.S., but only recently have I encountered steel-framed modular construction being used to build these types of structures.

Although the use of wood-framed modular construction on low-rise buildings has become increasingly common in North America, the modular industry here is still in its infancy. More sophisticated modular products, like steel-framed modular units for high-rises - and the processes behind utilizing them – are still a rarity and have only recently begun to reach our shores from places like Europe, where they have been implemented successfully for years.

&nbsp;
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Steel-Framed-Modular-Construction-For-High-Rise-Hotels-What-You-Need-To-Know-MGAC.pdf">Download the full guide</a></h4>
&nbsp;

I’ve learned much about the unique challenges and opportunities of high-rise steel-framed modular construction, including installation methods, benefits/limitations, potential pitfalls and the nuances, as well as misconceptions many owners and developers have about the product and its application. What follows is a snapshot of that insight, including recommendations on how to execute modular construction projects and the potential benefits of this innovative approach.
<h4><strong>First Things First: What Is Modular Construction?</strong></h4>
Modular construction is a process in which a majority (or portion) of the building is fabricated off-site under factory controlled conditions. The building is manufactured in pieces called "modules" that each include completed structure, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, furniture, fixtures, &amp; equipment, and exterior and interior finishes.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="823"]<img class="foter-photo mceItem" style="display: block; width: 823px;" src="http://www.ctbuh.org/Portals/0/events/2013/AtlanticYardsB2/B2_ModularSequence.jpg" alt="" width="823" height="646" /> <em>Source: Pinsdaddy</em>[/caption]

These modules are then transported to site where they are stacked (typically using cranes), sealed, and connected to mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (by general contractor crews) to form the completed building structure. Modular structures must adhere to the same building codes that conventionally built structures do, in addition to others which I will cover later.

In my experience, there are 2 main types of modules: “Room Pods” and “Structural Modules”. Room Pods are prefabricated building components integrated into traditional, on-site construction projects (ie: bathroom pods), while structural modules must support the weight of the building and are much more complex.

[caption id="attachment_1907" align="aligncenter" width="823"]<img class="wp-image-1907 " src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Saebu-Modulbau-Modular-Construction-1024x576.jpg" alt="Saebu Modulbau modular construction prefabricated steel frame modules" width="823" height="464" /> <em>Source: Saebu-modulbau</em>[/caption]

Steel-framed "structural" modules like the one shown above are simply modules built with steel framing rather than wood. These types of modules can be safely stacked much higher than their wood-frame counterparts.
<h4><strong>Why Go Modular?</strong></h4>
For those of you unfamiliar with modular construction, there are numerous advantages to employing this approach in a hotel development project. Below are the three main benefits, which apply to both steel and wood-framed modular units. I will dive deeper into each section further on in this blog.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reduced Construction Time:</strong> Modular units are delivered to the site pre-assembled and pre-finished, then stacked. Construction time can be reduced significantly, compared with conventionally built structures. This is especially important in dense urban areas, where traffic disruption and noise mitigation equate to significant costs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Higher Quality:</strong> By building and finishing modular units in a factory under controlled conditions, final product quality can be enhanced with a more precise fitting of components, and repetitive installation and finishing performed in a dry, climate-controlled environment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Less Cost and Waste:</strong> With reduced waste, reduced construction time, and completion of assembly and installation in a controlled environment, the possibilities for cost savings are compelling. Additionally, these cost savings often result in a “green” advantage for the project.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The Fine Print</strong></h4>
Modular construction is not suited for every hotel type or hotel brand.

Modules generally works best for select-service hotels that have built their brand standards around smaller guestrooms, as module sizes are typically based on the dimensions of shipping containers and/or the limitations of highway transport. Module widths and room widths also need to be compatible. A module-and-a-half-wide room is not practical for this approach.
<h4><strong>Time and Planning</strong></h4>
Modular construction is frequently touted as a time-saver. Time is money in construction, in terms of equipment rental, manpower, and lost revenue. With this method, contractors can stack multiple modules per day, potentially reducing total construction duration by a significant amount.

The challenge with the various phases of this process—namely design, permitting, fabrication, inspection and coordination—is planning ahead. A lot of developers want to get in the ground quickly, but with modular, there’s a lot of upfront legwork and planning that needs to happen. Time savings is an easy advantage to latch onto with modular, but there’s going to be more planning required. If you don’t start planning earlier, you will likely finish later, even with the shortened construction time.
<h4><strong>Cost</strong></h4>
There’s a common perception that building modular offers cost savings versus a traditional construction approach. However, there are many nuances that the owner and/or cost estimator needs to understand in order to skillfully develop a reliable cost comparison.

The fact that modular units are pre-manufactured can require cash flows to be more front-loaded than conventionally constructed projects. This will depend on the payment structure agreed upon with the fabricator.

The modular structure itself also differs significantly from its traditionally built counterparts, in terms of material (most hotel structures are concrete), erection process, and building components. Even though many components may have the same material costs, they could have very different installation costs, based on the differing location.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="823"]<img class="foter-photo mceItem" style="display: block; width: 823px;" src="http://www.vectorpraxis.com/images/newsmanager/large/2016-02-27-11-26-47-khw7-81574-81574vblocmodleavingvjig1920p.jpg" alt="" width="823" height="484" /> <em>Source: Pinsdaddy</em>[/caption]

Due to these factors and more, a comparative cost analysis should always be performed before embarking on a high-rise steel-framed modular project, to validate the anticipated cost savings and help determine whether the decision to go modular is right for a given project.
<h4><strong>Financing</strong></h4>
A developer/owner/operator may have very different tolerances for risk or rate of return thresholds than a developer seeking conventional financing with an ultimate goal of selling to investors. A developer/owner/operator - especially one that is familiar with modular construction - may place greater value on the quality potential or construction time-savings than the initial construction cost savings. Given the market's unfamiliarity with this product type, a hotel developer might require a higher return to take on what they perceive to be greater risk.

Likewise, because lenders and underwriters are unfamiliar with the product, they should be engaged early, to both explain the nuances of the product type and determine any special requirements they will have for participating in the project. As noted earlier, cash flow disbursements will be front-loaded in comparison with a conventionally built project. For a hotel developer proposing a modular project, there may be an extra layer of related upfront logistics for putting together a proforma. This includes who’s going to lend it, who’s going to buy it, and who’s going to operate it once it’s complete.
<h4><strong>Localization: Module Dimensions</strong></h4>
Although modular units offer the benefits of factory-built uniformity, there’s also a significant localization process for every project. Localizing may entail design based on site constraints, labor and market issues that need to be addressed to get the project built, or other factors such as seismic concerns.

If you build a modular hotel on a greenfield site next to the airport, you can simply buy your modules, stack them up, and build your hotel. All that changes when you build on an urban site, and/or you’re building between two other buildings.

Imagine your site is 119 feet wide but your module units are 10 feet wide. You can only fit 11 of these units on each floor, but your proforma dictates 12 guestrooms. Now to fit the required number of units per floor, each module must be downsized to 9.9 feet wide. Likewise, there are also height restrictions to consider.

This is one of the key challenges, because the idea of modular is mass production: to diminish cost and error in the factory in relation to the more things you can make the same. But the reality is, modules on urban sites end up being very customized for each location, because you just can’t afford to waste cubic footage or buildable area.
<h4><strong>Localization: Labor Unions</strong></h4>
In most cases, modules work for guestrooms, but not for common areas like lobbies, gyms, restaurants and bars, so the first one or two floors are built conventionally, and then the guestroom modules start stacking on the second or third floor.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="823"]<img class="foter-photo mceItem" style="display: block; width: 823px;" src="http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/getmedia/b8e66cb1-e624-41d7-b2ab-1e41f2f4e2b3/Aconex-Laing-O-Rourke-and-Hickory-Group-make-BRW-Top-50-Most-Innovative-Companies-list-423211-xl.aspx?" alt="" width="823" height="611" /> <em>Source: Pinsdaddy</em>[/caption]

Contractors still build the entire structure when using modular construction; it’s just that after the lower floors are complete, they will build the rest of the hotel using modules instead of steel or concrete.

This brings me to another important localization issue: the labor market where the hotel will be built and the acceptance by, and strength of, local construction unions. While off-site construction may offer an innovative means to enhance construction productivity, resistance may be encountered from local labor unions.
<h4><strong>Localization: Seismic Concerns</strong></h4>
Yet another item to consider among the localization factors are the seismic concerns: In higher seismic zones, such as the West Coast of the U.S., there’s a very different design to the modules compared to modules for non-seismic zones.

Structural engineers determine which parts of the building they want to resist seismic loads, and which parts they <em>don’t</em> want to resist seismic loads, because they want to transfer those loads elsewhere. The modules may actually need to be less stiff, because the structural engineer has designed the seismic loads to be transferred in different ways.

Therein lies another challenge, because the modules need to be transported to the site, then lifted into place by a crane. Generally, a stiffer module is better able to withstand the stresses of transport and installation; too flimsy of a module could result in twisting of the structure and cracks in the finished guestrooms. Besides needing a prototype room module to confirm quality and finishes (discussed later), prototypes may also be needed to test the suitability of the design for transport and installation.
<h4><strong>A Creative Structural Engineering Team</strong></h4>
Many of the completed modular projects in the U.S. are wood-frame units stacked three to four stories high. When you’re building three- and four-story modular hotels, it makes sense to design them all the same. But once you start stacking modules up 20 floors, the module on the bottom has to bear a lot more weight than the one on top.

This becomes a point of efficiency: You don’t want to build every module to be as strong as the one on the bottom, when the top ones can be a lot lighter and contain a lot less steel. This is because you buy steel by the pound, and on a high-rise building, steel is one of your highest costs. That drives the need to engineer steel thicknesses and related components for differing loads depending on where the module is located in the stack.

In this scenario, you’re no longer producing hundreds of identical modules; now you’re starting to customize them based on their location in the building, so each module has a limited number of places it can go. Typically, each module has a number and goes in a designated spot. If that module is damaged, it will need to be repaired on site, because the contractor can’t substitute a different module in its place. It’s possible that a module designated for the first floor is interchangeable with another one designated for the first floor, but not one that’s designated for the fifth floor.

For projects in seismic regions in particular, different methods should be considered in connecting the modules and in transferring seismic forces between them; each method may have different impacts on the amount of steel needed, and thus, on the efficiency of the design. A simple one-size-fits-all approach will not yield the most efficient design for a particular site or situation.
<h4><strong>Selecting a Fabricator: Can They Build It?</strong></h4>
In building something like a branded hotel room, you don’t just Google someone who says on their website, “I do modules,” and then sign them up. Vetting potential fabricators is a long process, including having them build a prototype first, to prove they can deliver the aesthetic and quality you and your brand (if applicable) require.

This can be challenging, especially since most manufacturers in the U.S. today only specialize in building wood-frame school classrooms or construction trailers; they may not yet be readily able to convert to high-rise steel-framed modules.

Partly because of the extensive fabricator vetting process one needs to undertake, don’t decide to go modular when you’re ready to build a hotel. If you think you want to build a modular hotel in two years, start now. That way, you’ll have time to vet vendors, get prototypes built and confirm that the cost equation works for your development, so that when you’re ready to build, you have a plan in place. If you try to start modular planning when it’s time to build, it likely won’t happen, because of the time required to successfully launch a modular project. There’s a significant upfront investment just to vet and select a manufacturer to work with.
<h4><strong>Selecting a Fabricator: Overseas or Domestic?</strong></h4>
While we all want to buy American, the reality is that the potential for cost savings with modular construction is enhanced if the modules are fabricated in an overseas factory. However, this is not without its risks. You need to confirm the ability of the fabricator to build to your specifications and to deliver the quality you require on the timing that meets your schedule.

The goal is to schedule the modules to arrive just in time; you don’t want your modules sitting in port for six months when you’ve paid for them, or learn your modular fabricator doesn’t have a slot open for you when you want your modules fabricated. There’s a lot of vetting and prototyping needed to ensure that once you’re ready to come out of the ground, you’ll have modules you’re confident in and can stack to be ready for guests when you’re finished.

<img class="wp-image-1926" style="-webkit-user-drag: none; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: -1ex;" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stocksnap-modular-construction-container.jpg" alt="modular construction container ships shipping from china and europe overseas customs" width="831" height="553" />

<em style="font-size: 14px; -webkit-user-drag: none;">Source: Stocksnap.io</em>

When using an overseas fabricator, there are many other technical factors to consider. For example, electrical and plumbing items used in the modules need to have a UL certification, which isn’t used in many other parts of the world. So for certain things, modular fabricators may need to ship UL rated components from the U.S. back to their factory location for installation in the modules.

Surprisingly, because most shipping containers leave the U.S. empty, it is relatively inexpensive to ship components from the U.S. to foreign shores, even heavy items such as fire-rated drywall.
<h4><strong>The Permitting Process: Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h4>
The permitting process takes on a higher level of complexity for high-rise, steel-framed modular projects, because approvals are required from two different agencies.

An important distinction for hotel owners and developers to note is that the modules themselves are regulated by a completely separate agency than the local building department, which traditionally handles inspections and permitting. With the modules, the process is similar to getting a UL sticker on a product; there’s a different set of regulations and different inspections that are performed on the modules. This is because once the units are brought to the site, they’re fully enclosed, so a building inspector can’t simply look inside the walls to see how the modules have been put together.

So essentially, there are two different approval processes: the local jurisdiction building department; and then typically, the applicable state agency that regulates factory-made, pre-assembled structures. There’s a completely different set of inspections that are required for the modules, and a different set of submittals and documents. When complete, the approving agency gives your module a seal of approval that certified the unit for installation.

Sometimes, there is an overlap in the demarcation between what is reviewed by the local building department and the state modular approval agency. For example, the state-level modular inspectors have to approve the fabrication of each module, but the local building department is responsible for a guestroom’s accessibility requirements. Or, at some point, the plumbing and electrical components of the module will need to connect to site-installed and building department-approved installations. The calculations for capacities and connections need to be coordinated between the two reviewing agencies.  This creates a layer of complexity, requiring designers to develop documents that can address the different needs of these various agencies.
<h4><strong>The Permitting Process: Working With Inspectors</strong></h4>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="823"]<img class="foter-photo mceItem" style="display: block; width: 823px;" src="http://pop.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/05/54cbf6f6e4a80_-_modular-high-rise-01-1014-de.jpg" alt="" width="823" height="547" /> <em>Source: Pinsdaddy</em>[/caption]

With a typical building permit, once you get permission to start building, the building inspector comes by every other week, or you call him/her for specific inspections before covering up sections. But with modules, because they’re assembled in a factory and things are happening every day, the modular regulatory authority typically requires that there be an inspector in the factory for the full duration of the time the modules are being manufactured, wherever in the world that factory may be located.

Some states, like California and New York, will allow the inspections to be performed by third-party inspectors who are certified by the state to perform inspections for them. But in states where this option doesn’t exist, the state inspectors must travel to the factory to perform the inspections. Due to limited resources, it may be more challenging to ensure that state inspectors are available when you need them, which can limit uptime during the manufacturing process.
<h4><strong>What Modular Means For The Hospitality And Construction Industry</strong></h4>
There is an expectation that over time, industries will self-invent processes that lead to productivity gains, which in turn lead to reduced cost. At the moment however, interest in high-rise, steel-framed modular construction is primarily being driven by owners and developers, who are seeking to reap the benefits of the enhanced productivity/lowered cost and higher quality made possible by the approach.

Despite this growing interest, high-rise steel-framed modular construction remains a very select proposition, only suitable for specific building types, and only compatible with certain brands and price points. It also requires significant upfront investment, work, and careful planning, but when executed properly, it could be exactly the kind of innovation that hotel owners and developers have been eagerly awaiting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC Research tracked 303 non-confidential, single-asset, mid-scale and up hotel transactions across the US in 2017. These properties totaled over 73,500 keys, and can be explored in the interactive cluster map below:

<iframe src="//www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Map3.html" name="frame1" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="no" scrolling="auto" align="center"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
</iframe>

The U.S. hotel industry performed at <a href="http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/268674/STR-US-hotel-industry-posts-record-year-in-2017">record-breaking levels</a> last year with key metrics such as occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR reaching unprecedented heights. Although new hotel supply also reached record heights in 2017, demand was even higher and still outstripped the number of new rooms coming to market.

This spectacular performance, combined with a favorable fiscal landscape, has led to a significant drop in the number properties changing hands last year. According to Real Capital Analytics, the number of US hotel transactions in 2017 <a href="https://www.rcanalytics.com/usct-preview-2017-yir/">fell nearly 25%</a> from 2016 - the largest drop across all asset classes.

Most transactions were concentrated in South Florida, Southern California, New York City, the Washington Metro Area, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Despite this activity along the coasts, some opportunistic hotel investors surveyed have reported a growing shift in interest from high-priced coastal cities to the secondary markets concentrated in the central US, where asking prices more palatable and target return rates are easier to achieve.
<h4><strong>Top 10 Largest Deals (By Transaction Amount)</strong></h4>
Numerous casino hotels changed hands last year, with 4 of the 10 largest transactions being gaming related hotels. Favorable legislation and market conditions in 2017 spurred activity from sellers looking for capital to develop new projects, as well as buyers seeking opportunities to kick-start stalled projects.

We also saw two large property divestments in the top 10 from Marriott-Starwood and Hyatt as they, along with several other major brands, shift into an asset light strategy.
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="37e333cb-ec29-4900-8585-ec6d172160d1" data-type="interactive" data-title="2017 Largest Hotel Deals"> <script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></div>
<h4><strong>Top 10 Most Expensive Hotel Transactions (by Price Per Key)</strong></h4>
With nearly one-third of all recorded 2017 US hotel transactions, markets in Florida and California are extremely competitive and were home to 5 of the 10 most expensive hotel deals. The average cost per key in these states were $206,000 and $336,000, respectively.

Despite ongoing concerns of oversupply, New York made 3 appearances in the top 10 and continues to attract big money and reported an average cost per key of $427,000. Investors and developers remain optimistic because of record setting tourism numbers and strong historic performance.

Notable: Although with no single transaction in the top 10, Washington state finished the year with a very high average cost per key of $465,000 due to high development activity in the Seattle market.
<h4><strong>Distribution of Hotel Tiers</strong></h4>
Marriott-Starwood and Hilton continued to be the most popular franchise branded deals in 2017. Top upscale brands were Courtyard, Double Tree, Hilton Garden Inn, and Hyatt Place. Top upper upscale brands included Marriott, Hyatt Regency, and Westin.

<h4><strong>Top Buyers and Sellers</strong></h4>
The top buyers and sellers each completed 4-5 non-confidential, single-asset, mid-scale-and-up hotel deals in 2017.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As reported by the Washington D.C. Economic Partnership, the Washington D.C. construction market just experienced its <a href="https://wdcep.com/reports/dc-development-report/">sixth year of consecutive growth</a> and added a total of nearly 27 million square feet, the majority of which was private sector development.

The District’s annual construction permit volume reached a six-year record high in 2017, a 30% increase from 2012 (when the District first began publicly releasing permit data). This includes over 30 developments each valued over $100 million, and a total combined construction value exceeding $9 billion.

Other cities within the Washington D.C. Metro Region such as Arlington and Bethesda have also experienced significant growth as they compete to attract businesses and as financing has become more accessible.

Construction markets within the Metro Region are closely interconnected, with capital and labor moving fluidly throughout the region. The continuous high volume of development activity throughout the Metro Region has reduced the competitiveness of the local construction market, impacting labor costs and increasing escalation rates and market volatility for most subtrades. The current condition is expected to continue as we see strong market activities extending through 2019.

This report will provide construction-related statistics that detail the volume of growth in construction permits and development activities, as well as an analysis of how the activity has impacted both our private and public sector clients.
<h4><strong>Construction Permit Volume</strong></h4>
Construction permit volume in Washington D.C. has climbed steadily since 2012, reaching a six-year record high in 2017. Last year’s permit volume was not only higher in aggregate but also on a month-by-month basis, indicating a consistently more active construction market throughout the year.

&nbsp;
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="0b564afd-570b-4b65-9fb3-9f4f606967cf" data-type="interactive" data-title="Washington D.C. Construction Permits"></div>
<script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

This volume of permits has extended average permit processing in the District to an average of 6 to 12 months - a significantly longer timeline than similarly hot markets such as Seattle, which currently averages 4 months.

Permit processing in Washington D.C. is a complex affair, with 10 agencies involved in processing building permits. However, recent news of a <a href="https://dc.urbanturf.com/articles/blog/council-of-dc-suggests-dividing-dcra/13481">proposed bill to split</a> the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) could streamline the construction permitting process and shorten processing times.

<em>Note: Construction permit data referenced above is specific to Washington D.C. Granular-level data for surrounding counties, districts, and cities within the Washington D.C. Metro Region were not publicly accessible at the time of publication.</em>
<h4><strong>Sector Activity</strong></h4>
<strong><span style="color: #0095c3;">Private Sector Activity</span></strong>

An expanding private job market has driven the region’s economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2016, private sector employment has experienced a 16.6% growth, while the public sector grew by only 5.9%. With tens of thousands of new, high paying jobs created, private developers have rushed to accommodate the new demand, particularly in the commercial office and residential markets.
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="03938ea5-6c5b-47a8-825b-7fc691e38234" data-type="interactive" data-title="Washington D.C. Construction Spending"></div>
<script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

This explosion of work has been made possible as lending and financing rates have dropped to historic lows, and as institutions have made post-GFC loans more accessible to developers – particularly for project types with lower perceived risk, such as multi-family. But even “riskier” asset classes, such as hotels, are attracting large volumes of capital and have grown rapidly.

&nbsp;
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/how-were-advising-our-hospitality-clients-in-the-booming-washington-dc-construction-market/">Learn how we're advising our hospitality clients in the Washington D.C. market here.</a></strong></h6>
&nbsp;

Foreign capital has also <a href="https://wtop.com/business-finance/2018/01/web-story-dc-foreign-investors/">played a significant role</a> in driving private developments in DC. Investors from China, Japan, and the Middle East are attracted by the stability of the market and been instrumental in financing a number of projects across the region.

<strong><span style="color: #0095c3;">Public Sector Activity</span></strong>

Entering last year, there were high hopes for increased infrastructure spending in the US. However, the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) has reported that <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=hPkC">public construction spending has generally remained stagnant across the country</a>.

In Washington D.C., the gap between private and public sector development activity has grown greater than the national average as public spending first plateaued and then declined.

The key driver of previous booms - large government initiatives and projects such as BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) - are now notably absent. Public agencies such as the General Services Administration (GSA) are now not only facing <a href="https://federalnewsradio.com/budget/2017/09/civilian-agency-cuts-in-house-spending-bill-are-deep-not-as-drastic-as-trumps-proposal/">tighter budgets</a> but are also struggling to control construction costs in the hot, private sector driven market.

We can see the effects of these conditions throughout the public sector. Some agencies have taken drastic measures including placing projects on hold in the hopes that the prices will eventually settle back down, as in the case of the FBI headquarters project <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2017/07/10/e25c1080-65af-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html?utm_term=.afda2a070e25">cancellation</a>.

Other agencies are going through a redesign process to bring their projects back under previously established budgets, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) headquarters which saw a <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/07/exclusive-a-new-cfpb-scandal-cost-overruns-for-its-new-lux-headquarters/">construction cost overrun by over 25%.</a>
<h4><strong>Major Projects In Development</strong></h4>
The current development pipeline in the Washington D.C. Metro Region is characterized by large-scale waterfront developments, mixed-use neighborhoods, and transit-oriented developments.

MGAC’s Research Group has tracked 40 developments in the region valued above $100 million. The total combined value in the pipeline exceeds $12 billion.

<h4><img class="alignnone wp-image-2151" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/legend.jpg" alt="MGAC Washington DC Metro Region 2018 Construction Market Report" width="373" height="61" /></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Construction Congestion</strong></h4>
This sustained volume of construction has resulted in a very high demand for construction services, making it difficult to attract local and neighboring contractors and subcontractors.

The lack of competition and price fluctuations from this demand have also made it challenging to accurately predict bid activities. This uncertainty could be compounded by recent natural disasters such as Hurricane Irma. Although such disruptions are likely to be transient, we expect the impact to bring perceived uncertainty to the market – similar to how <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/the-cost-impact-of-hurricane-harvey-on-the-texas-construction-market/">Hurricane Harvey affected the Southwestern US region</a>.

MGAC’s Cost &amp; Risk Group is advising our clients through these uncertain times. We are helping our clients recognize the reality of hard price increases and bid volatility, the bid market, as well as managing risks on their projects.

In the coming months, MGAC’s Cost + Risk group will be publishing additional papers covering recommended strategies for procurement, effectively managing escalation, and risk mitigation measures.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the 10<sup>th</sup> year I’ve attended the Americas Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS) conference.  I always look forward to attending this particular conference because it brings together all the parties that make up the hotel ecosystem - from investors, developers, asset managers, operators, to construction professionals such as architects, interior designers, procurement agents and development managers such as myself.

It’s a great opportunity to reconnect with clients and industry colleagues, catching up and keeping myself informed of new industry and design trends. This year for the first time, technology was prominently featured at the ALIS conference. From AI, big data, robots, chatbots, to mobile technology, nearly every discussion this year touched on how technology was reshaping hospitality.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgIQcWcMBUk"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2165 size-large" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Relay-ALIS-1024x536.png" alt="ALIS conference 2018 MGAC dermot ryan relay robot savioke technology AI" width="1024" height="536" /></a>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savioke's Relay Robot was a big hit at this year’s conference.</span></i>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">But at the end of the day, I along with the thousands of others who attended came to find out who’s selling, buying, building, and swapping - essentially to learn about upcoming deals and to have a better understand where the market is heading. </span>I had some concerns going in about whether the hotel sector would continue on its current track, given that we’re in an extended cycle and uncertainty around the new tax code.

Although there was some apprehension of the dip in tourism last year due to the travel ban, national hotel performance remains at record-level heights. In one session I attended, it was forecast that demand would continue to outpace supply and that occupancy would hold steady for the next two years.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-2179 size-large" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ALIS-hotel-forecast-3-1024x540.jpg" alt="ALIS conference 2018 hotel outlook hospitality industry supply demand occupancy rate adr average daily rate RevPAR dermot ryan MGAC STR CBRE" width="1024" height="540" />

This confidence is in large part attributed to the new tax bill. The overall consensus of those I spoke with was that the reform is generally good for business and that this will carry over to the hospitality industry.  It remains to be seen how this new law will impact transactions and new developments moving forward. This is something that we’re monitoring and will report on moving forward.

On the deal side, REITs and private equity firms have the capital to invest but they’re not finding deals that meet their investment criteria. Most felt that this was because record-breaking hotel performance and relatively low interest rates have made potential sellers reluctant to lower their asking prices. At the same time, inflation, construction costs, and the labor shortage continue to rise across the nation. Some investors are just sitting on capital while they search for other asset classes that can generate their target returns, while other owners have been working to streamline their development and renovation projects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed an order to place a 25% and 10% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, respectively, effective March 23, 2018. The new tariff <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-brazil-south-korea-and-others-get-temporary-exemptions-from-trumps-steel-tariffs/2018/03/22/9d0fac5a-2de4-11e8-8dc9-3b51e028b845_story.html?utm_term=.8a9707b20a24">granted a temporary exemption</a> to certain countries including Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and the European Union until May 1, 2018, as discussions continue.

Now that the steel tariffs are in place, the question everyone is asking is <em>“What does this mean to the cost of my construction project?” </em> While this is a straightforward question, the answer may not be as simple.
<h4><strong>US Steel Import Volume</strong></h4>
The United States is the world’s largest importer of steel, importing approximately 35 million metric tons in 2017, which accounted for 33% of the total steel used in the country.

Nearly 60% of this total imported volume originates from five countries, including Canada and Mexico which alone accounted for 25% of the total imported volume.

<h4><strong>Putting It into Context </strong></h4>
Raw steel is used in the construction of a number of different building components including reinforcing steel in structural concrete, structural steel framing, and miscellaneous metal framing and supports. Although the tariff will affect all these components, the single biggest impact will be on structural steel in steel framed buildings.

The cost of structural steel is typically composed of four main components – raw material, fabrication, delivery, and erection on site. While the cost of these can and will vary over time and by geographic location, raw steel has historically been around 30% of the total cost per ton for structural steel.

According to ENR, <a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/44200-steel-aluminum-tariffs-will-hit-prices-hard-through-year-end">prices for raw steel</a> currently range between $700-800 per ton, meaning the 25% tariff would result in an increase of $175-200 per ton.

To put this cost increase into context, we used two typical construction projects as examples:
<blockquote style="border-radius: 10px; border: 0px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ecf1f1;"><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Example I: A new 100,000 GSF academic building with a structural steel frame of 15 lbs/sf located in the Mid-Atlantic Region</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Overall cost of building at $350/sf:  <b>$350/sf x 100,000 sf = $35M</b></li>
 	<li>Overall quantity of structural steel in the building: <b>$15 lbs/sf x 100,000 sf = 1,500,000 LBS = 750 tn</b></li>
 	<li>Cost of raw steel = <b>$800/tn </b>(ENR)</li>
 	<li>Cost of structural steel: <b>$4,000/tn</b> (MGAC benchmark data; note this cost include the $800/tn raw material cost)</li>
 	<li>Overall cost of structural steel in the building: <b>750 tn x $4,000/tn = $3M </b>(9% of total building cost)</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: black;">Apply 25% tariff to the raw steel portion of the structural steel only:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Overall cost increase due to tariff: <b>25% x $800/tn x 750 tn = $150,000</b> (0.43% of total building cost)</li>
</ul>
<strong style="color: #0095c3;">Example II: A new 500,000 GSF high-rise residential building with a structural steel frame of $30LBS/SF located in Southern California</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Overall cost of building at $500/sf: <b>$500/sf x 500,000 sf = $250M</b></li>
 	<li>Overall quantity of structural steel in the building: <b>$30 lbs/sf x 500,000 sf = 15,000,000 lbs = 7,500 tn</b></li>
 	<li>Cost of raw steel = <b>$800/tn</b> (ENR)</li>
 	<li>Cost of structural steel: <b>$4,000/tn</b> (MGAC benchmark data; note this cost include the $800/tn raw material cost)</li>
 	<li>Overall cost of structural steel in the building: <b>7,500 tn x $4,000/tn = $30M</b> (12% of total building cost)</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: black;">Apply 25% tariff to the raw steel portion of the structural steel only:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Overall cost increase due to tariff = <b>25% x $800/tn x 7,500 tn = $1.5M</b> (0.6% of total building cost)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
These examples illustrate the relatively minor impact that an increase in the price of raw steel would have on the overall building construction cost - in most cases, less than 1%.

&nbsp;

Note that all of the above refers to construction projects using raw steel. Imported prefabricated steel products, such as those used in certain <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/steel_framed_modular_construction_for_high_rise_hotels_what_you_need_to_know/">types of modular buildings</a>, are not considered raw steel and therefore not subject to the tariff.
<h4><strong>How The Steel Tariff Will Impact Construction Costs</strong></h4>
We anticipate that the tariff will impact construction costs in two ways:
<h5><strong>Increased Production Overhead </strong></h5>
First, the increased price of raw steel from the tariff will disrupt the supply chain for domestic steel manufacturers, most likely straining production capacity in the short term.

Currently in the US, the <a href="http://www.steel.org/about-aisi/statistics.aspx">capacity utilization rate for steel mills is around 75%</a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-steel-capacity/trump-tariffs-could-cost-as-well-as-create-u-s-steel-jobs-idUKKCN1GJ39T">30 million tons</a> of annual idled capacity. The goal of the tariff is to increase this to 80%, which is viewed as the minimum rate for long-term viability of the industry. However, production is unlikely to ramp up overnight.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2280" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ant-rozetsky-140870-unsplash-1024x536.jpg" alt="MGAC Steel Producing Manufacturer" width="1024" height="536" />

According to Michelle Applebaum, a steel industry analyst, <em>“the U.S. steel industry should be able to meet most demand, but even plants like Granite City and Ashland, which have been kept ready to restart, take <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel-capacity/trump-tariffs-could-cost-as-well-as-create-u-s-steel-jobs-idUSKCN1GJ39R">four to six months</a> to be ready for production.”</em> Likewise, it also takes time for fabricators who historically use imported steel as raw inputs to build business relationships and switch to domestic suppliers.

Assuming the increase in production capacity can be achieved, it will likely push the cost of domestic steel up due to additional overhead costs for hiring more workers, increased plant operation cycles, and potential start-up costs for reopening mills that are currently closed.
<h5><strong>Uncertainty</strong></h5>
Second, as the industry learns how to respond and adjust to the steel tariffs, price uncertainty will elevate the level of risk that contractors and subcontractors face when bidding on projects.

Contractors and subcontractors will be especially vulnerable to price fluctuations between the time they submit a bid to when they are awarded the contract. The most likely response to this heightened risk will be an increase in bid prices to cover the risk of fluctuation, and/or the addition of a clause to limit the amount of time a price can be held. We believe that this situation will resolve itself over the next several months as fabricators work to lock in prices and potentially alternate sources for raw materials.
<h4><strong>Recommendations </strong></h4>
As with all materials, market demand will continue to play the leading role in actual material price increases. Assuming the US construction market and demand for steel continues to remain robust, the tariffs will likely result in further steel cost increases.

Current indicators suggest that the <a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/44200-steel-aluminum-tariffs-will-hit-prices-hard-through-year-end">present level of construction across the US will continue strong</a> through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Many of our contacts in the industry have reported that they expect this volume of construction to level off and slowdown beginning late 2019 to early 2020. Once this happens, demand should reduce, effectively alleviating price pressure points for steel as well as other materials.

In the meantime, we recommend our clients take the following measures to manage the risk of material cost increases on their upcoming projects:
<h5><strong>For Projects In Planning Or Design</strong></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Review cost assumptions for structural steel (priority) and reinforcing steel and other miscellaneous steel components (secondary). Consider price adjustments to mitigate potential risk. MGAC currently recommends a $200/TN adjustment for steel and rebar.</li>
 	<li>Monitor market conditions at regular intervals for change.</li>
 	<li>Review project contingency levels for appropriateness.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>For Projects Bidding Within The Next 6 Months</strong></h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Understand procurement or contractual options for sourcing raw steel products for your project.</li>
 	<li>Review bid documents relating to price guarantee duration or consider fluctuation clauses specific to material cost to limit bidder risk.</li>
 	<li>Consider a bidding contingency as protection against high bids.</li>
 	<li>Consider options for early or pre-purchase of steel to lock in prices.</li>
</ul>
As the effects of this policy unfold, we are getting more clarity on the full extent of the tariff's impacts. Stay tuned as we continue to monitor this issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The number of hotel transactions across the US remain limited as hotels continue to deliver <a href="http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/284104/STR-US-hotel-performance-for-March-2018">record-breaking performance</a> across key metrics including occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR.

Despite the considerable number of new hotel developments entering the market as seen in our Q1 2018 Hotel Developments report, demand continues to outpace supply, creating an unfavorable environment for potential buyers.
<h4><strong>Hotel Transactions Map</strong></h4>
In Q1 2018, MGAC Research tracked 43 major single-asset hotel transactions across the US, a year-on-year drop from the 79 transactions recorded in Q1 2017.

These transactions include 12, 10, and 21 hotel properties that changed hands in January, February, and March, respectively, and represent a combined value of over $2.7 billion and 10,600 total hotel rooms, with an average price per key of $265,620.

<iframe style="border: none;" src="https://view-awesome-table.com/-L9gBj3Uv-N8BUGO1bdE/view" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Activities By State</strong></h4>
Florida and Virginia saw the highest volume of hotel deals in Q1 2018, with 4 major single-asset transactions. Maine, Georgia, Texas, Washington, Oregon and California followed with 3 transactions each.

In terms of average price per key, Oregon led the way with $507,000/key, followed by California with $412,000/key, and New York with $364,000/key.

<h4><strong>Scale Distribution</strong></h4>
Upper Upscale and Upscale hotel chains comprised more than half of the deals in Q1 2018. Marriott-Starwood was once again the most popular franchise brand, accounting for 17 of the 43 total recorded transactions. Notably, there was no significant difference between the average cost per key between these two scales.

Independent branded properties, particularly those located near natural attractions, were also attractive to investors. Notable transaction included the 77-room Landing Tahoe Resort &amp; Spa in South Lake Tahoe acquired by DiamondRock Hospitality at $545,000 per key, the Eagle Crest Resort and Rocky Point Resort in Oregon, and the 394-room Georgia Chateau Elan Winery &amp; Resorts acquired by Wheelock Street Capital.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/q1-2018-us-hotel-transactions/">hotel transactions</a> across the US continue to remain limited, the first quarter of 2018 saw a large number hotel developments enter markets across the US. MGAC Research tracked a total of 154 hotel openings, which include 103 new developments that added nearly 16,000 hotel rooms to the US market.

As shown in the map below, these hotel development activities were concentrated in the mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and select regions of California.

<iframe style="border: none;" src="https://view-awesome-table.com/-LAUdw7QUXZ_ca5tXlnO/view" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
<h4><strong>Hotel Openings</strong></h4>
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Geographic Distribution</h5>
California, Florida, and Texas saw the most hotel openings in Q1 2018 with 21, 16, and 12 openings, respectively.

In terms of total number of rooms opened in Q1 2018, Texas, Georgia, and Florida led with 2,355, 1,859, and 1,595 rooms entering the market, respectively.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Brand &amp; Scale</h5>
38% of new hotels opened under the Marriott flag, followed by Hilton and independent properties with 18% each. Upper upscale, upscale, and upper midscale properties each accounted for more than 20% of the openings.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Significant Openings</h5>
Q1 2018 saw 9 significant hotel openings, each valued above $100 million:

<iframe class="airtable-embed" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="https://airtable.com/embed/shrb9I5Z9MyhHGGc1?backgroundColor=yellow&amp;viewControls=on" width="100%" height="533" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4><strong>Development Pipeline</strong></h4>
As of Q1 2018, MGAC Research tracked 420 hotels in the development pipeline - 47% under construction at the time of this report, 35% in planning, and 18% in early proposal stage. Over 80% of the developments in the pipeline are new construction, which could inject up to 77,000 additional rooms into the US market.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Geographic Distribution</h5>
Moving forward, California, Florida, and Texas are in position to continue leading in new hotel developments with 66, 41, and 23 new hotel developments in the pipeline, respectively.

In terms of total number of rooms in the pipeline, however, Nevada jumped to the third position after California and Florida, driven by three significant casino hotel projects in Las Vegas, notably the 2000-room <a href="https://www.ktnv.com/news/wynn-wants-new-hotel-across-vegas-strip-from-his-2-towers_89390474">Wynn West Hotel</a>, the 1500-room <a href="https://lasvegasweekly.com/intersection/2018/jan/23/wynn-west-new-hotel-paradise-park-las-vegas-strip/">Wynn Paradise Park</a>, and the 4000-room <a href="https://www.hotel-online.com/press_releases/release/marriott-international-and-witkoff-to-develop-integrated-resort-and-casino">Drew Las Vegas</a> (Former unfinished Fontainebleau), all with scheduled delivery dates after 2020.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Brand &amp; Scale</h5>
Major brands Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt respectively comprise 20%, 15% and 8% of the new development pipeline, but independent properties have been rapidly gaining popularity, now accounting for 25% of all the developments in the pipeline that have announced a brand flag.

In terms of scale, upscale properties account for 21% of the pipeline, followed by upper upscale properties with 16%.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Most Anticipated Openings in 2018</h5>
More than 40 projects currently in the pipeline are scheduled to be delivered in 2018.

Below are a few of the most anticipated openings in 2018, with an estimated cost around or above $100 million.

<iframe class="airtable-embed" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="https://airtable.com/embed/shrgi9clxCFDBIghb?backgroundColor=yellow&amp;viewControls=on" width="100%" height="533" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4><strong>Notable Trends</strong></h4>
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Adaptive Reuse</h5>
The number of adaptive reuse projects across the US has been steadily increasing.

As of Q1 2018, MGAC Research has recorded over 60 adaptive reuse projects, including 22 currently under construction, and 30 proposed or in planning. California has the highest number of hotel conversions, concentrated in Downtown LA, followed by Downtown Atlanta, Washington DC, and New York City.
<h5 style="color: #0095c3;">Casino Hotel Expansion</h5>
Over the past year, we have witnessed an increasing amount of investment by casino resort owners, including renovations, expansions, and new developments.

Although this expansion trend can be seen in smaller casinos across the US, the bulk of these projects are, not surprisingly, being initiated by the major players based out of Las Vegas, Nevada.

According to our data, by 2021, more than 11,000 new hotel rooms will be added to casino resorts across the US, not including renovated rooms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In April 2018, US non-residential construction spending exceeded the previous peak in 2008 by 4%. The <a href="https://www.aia.org/press-releases/179361-architecture-billings-continue-growth-into-">AIA Architectural Billing Index (ABI)</a>, forecasts that this level of activity is expected to extend into 2019. The <a href="https://www.aia.org/pages/89761-abi-april-2017-firm-billings-grow-at-slower-">Western US Region</a> in particular has shown the strongest indicators of continued growth, with a leading average score of 55.7, compared with 54.3 for the South, 53.3 for the Midwest, and 47.9 for the Northeast. Construction employment in Los Angeles alone is projected to grow 3.75% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, as reported by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC).

By the end of March 2018, the number of permits issued by the City of Los Angeles alone had already exceeded the total 2017 volume by 1,000. Unique growth drivers for Los Angeles County include robust entertainment, biotech, transportation, defense, finance, and healthcare industries, and an ambitious urban revitalization plan, which includes preparations for the upcoming 2028 Olympics.

Although this report focuses primarily on construction activities within the City of Los Angeles, markets throughout the region are closely linked and our analysis and recommendations are generally applicable to all cities within the County.

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Private Development Activity</strong></h4>
MGAC Research tracks private developments in the proposed, planned, or under construction stage on an ongoing basis. As of June 2018, this includes nearly 50 major private projects in the pipeline across the County, the majority of which are concentrated in Downtown South Park, Koreatown, and Hollywood.

<iframe class="airtable-embed" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="https://airtable.com/embed/shrOGa2nqLi6ars4g?backgroundColor=gray&amp;viewControls=on" width="100%" height="533" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Over 85% of projects in the pipeline feature a residential component, with many of the units, particularly in <a href="https://www.downtownla.com/images/reports/BID.MarketReport2016.Q4.v7OPT.pdf">Downtown LA</a>, being positioned as “luxury” housing. Among these projects include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/12/12/16767876/angels-landing-development-macfarlane-handel">Angels Landing</a></strong> - A $1.2 billion, 88-story mixed-use tower which was approved in December 2017.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/1/22/16919512/frank-gehry-los-angeles-grand-avenue-project"><strong>Grand Avenue</strong></a> - A $1-billion Frank Gehry designed project scheduled to break ground in Fall 2018.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://archinect.com/news/article/150060710/studio-gang-s-first-la-project-will-be-a-wavy-high-rise-in-chinatown"><strong>Chinatown High Rise</strong></a> - A Studio Gang designed 26-story, wavy glass and steel tower that will add 294 apartment units and 149 hotel rooms to the old Chinatown neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
There are also several other major, non-high-rise mixed use projects that are changing the landscape of the city, notably the $1.2 billion <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/what-is-a-narrative-art-museum-george-lucas-1258994">Lucas Museum of Narrative Art</a> which broke ground in March 2018.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Downtown Hotel Developments On The Rise</strong></h5>
The Department of Convention and Tourism Development set a goal in 2012 to increase the total number of hotel rooms within <a href="http://ctd.lacity.org/sites/default/files/CTD%20Annual%20Report%2012-13.pdf">walking distance of the Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC</a>) to 8,000 rooms by 2020. As of October 2017, <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/cd14/pages/2723/attachments/original/1508870241/CD14_Hotel_Market_Study-2017_Full___Report-Final.pdf?1508870241">67% of this goal has been met</a>, with over 4,600 hotel rooms available in the market and over 700 new rooms under construction.

An additional 3,000 hotel rooms have been proposed near the LACC, that, upon completion in 2020, would move the City forward to reaching its goal. Major hotels in planning include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://urbanize.la/post/fresh-renderings-fig-pico-hotel-towers"><strong>Fig+Pico Conference Center Hotels</strong></a> - A 1,000-room hotel developed by the Lightstone Group.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-convention-center-hotel-20170223-story.html"><strong>City Lights Hotel Towers</strong></a> - A 1024-room hotel developed by TriCal Construction Inc.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://urbanize.la/post/1020-figueroa-approved-planning-commission"><strong>W Hotel at 1020 S Figueroa</strong> </a>- A 300-room hotel by Chinese developer Shenzhen Hazens.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/story-mixed-use-tower-proposed-for-figueroa-street/article_827bd192-e980-11e6-b562-afb506a7f175.html"><strong>1600 S. Figueroa</strong></a> - A 250-room hotel within the mixed-use tower developed by L&amp;R Group of Companies.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/figueroa-centre-third-tallest-building/"><strong>Figueroa Centre</strong></a> - A 220-room, 66-story hotel by Regalian LLC.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-aeg-convention-center-20180508-story.html"><strong>JW Marriott LA Live</strong></a> – A 850-room, 40 story hotel developed by LA Convention Center operator AEG</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Foreign Investment Slows But Interest Remains High</strong></h5>
Although LA County continues to draw the bulk of foreign investment in Southern California, the overall volume has fallen.

Construction activities by foreign-owned enterprises have followed this shift with <a href="https://laedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WTCLA_2018_FDI-Report.pdf">a nearly 60% drop</a> in number of jobs and wages paid. Over the last year, the high-profile withdrawal of Chinese developers and investors due to mainland capital control policies have been a major contributor to this trend, with Chinese investments reportedly <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-chinese-investment-falls-20180327-story.html">declining by 67% since 2017</a>. Only a handful of Chinese developments remain on-track in Downtown LA, including:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://urbanize.la/post/three-tower-olympia-development-considers-adding-hotel">Olympia</a> -</strong> a $1 billion tri-tower development and <a href="http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/1233-s-grand/19842"><strong>1233 Grand Ave</strong></a>, a 24-story residential tower. Both projects are being developed by City Century, a subsidiary of Shanghai based Shenglong Group.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/1/22/16919512/frank-gehry-los-angeles-grand-avenue-project">Grand Avenue Project</a> -</strong> a $1-billion project developed by Related and funded in part with $290 million from CORE, a subsidiary of China Communications Construction.</li>
 	<li><strong>1020 S Figueroa -</strong> a $700 million mixed-use development by Shenzhen Hazens.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://urbanize.la/post/new-look-koreatowns-wilshire-gate-tower">The Wilshire Gate</a> -</strong> A 33-story mixed-use tower in Koreatown, developed by Jia Long USA, a subsidiary of Jia Long Beijing.</li>
</ul>
Despite this slowdown in investment activities, interest in Southern California real estate, particularly trophy assets, continues to remain strong.

According to Young Kim, Managing Director of <a href="https://8thbridgecap.com/">8<sup>th</sup> Bridge Capital</a>, an LA based investment management firm specializing in Asian EB-5 and private equity funding, “<em>Chinese investors are still very much interested in what they consider to be stable and often undervalued assets here in LA when compared to other global Tier 1 cities like Beijing or Shanghai. Many of my Chinese clients believe that these capital controls are a temporary measure employed by their government due to sensitivities in the current US-China trade relationship.”</em>

Investors from other Asian countries share a favorable image of LA and, less restricted by government policies, are continuing to ramp up their exposure to real estate across the County. <em>“Koreans, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese investors are very eager to invest here” </em>notes Kim. “<em>I am asked on a weekly basis to find a real estate deal that ranges anywhere from $1 million to $500 million”. </em>

Korean and Taiwanese investments are primarily conducted by institutional players looking to participate in syndicate deals, while Vietnamese investor activity is focused around ultra-high net worth individuals looking for private equity deals, typically under $30 million, or EB-5 deals.

In an upcoming report, MGAC’s development advisory and lender services groups will be analyzing foreign investment trends including challenges and misconceptions of EB-5 funding.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Linkage Fee for Private Developments in DTLA </strong></h5>
In December 2017, the LA City Council approved the Linkage Fee, a fee on development that is expected to generate $104.4 million in annual revenue. The City plans to direct these funds toward the construction and preservation of affordable housing.

The linkage fee will have an immediate cost impact for developments filed after June 18, 2018. The current fee employs <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/12/13/16772046/linkage-fees-los-angeles-affordable-housing">a tiered structure</a> in which residential developers are charged between $8-15 per square foot, and commercial developers $3-5 per square foot.  However, the City is exploring the feasibility of increasing the linkage fee amount to $18 per square foot for residential development projects in wealthier “high market” areas including Hollywood and DTLA.

The linkage fees would be phased in 3 steps, beginning four months after the ordinance effective date of February 17, 2018:
<ul>
 	<li>One-third of the total linkage fee amount will be charged for developers submitting building permit or entitlement applications on or after June 18, 2018</li>
 	<li>Two-thirds of the total linkage fee amount will be charged if applications are submitted on or after December 20, 2018</li>
 	<li>The full linkage fee amount will be charged for applications submitted on or after June 17, 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Challenges In The Entitlement Process Continue</strong></h5>
With the amount of large developments planned in LA, the entitlement process is becoming more difficult.

Owners of large development projects may go through lengthy deliberations with the local community to address various issues including affordable housing, environmental concerns, and employment opportunities.

One example is the $1.2 billion Broadway Square development (The Reef) in South Park. Over a year since it was approved in November 2016, ground-breaking was finally able to proceed after a public benefits package was agreed upon. This package included the provisions that 5% of the 1,400 units would be set aside for low-income residents, an $18 million contract to preserve affordable housing contracts in the community, and a commitment of giving 30% of the construction jobs to local workers.

Challenges in entitlements are one of many nuances in the local development process that have deterred foreign developers. Even sophisticated Chinese developers with successful overseas developments have faced issues in navigating complex local regulations and procedures that have resulted in schedule or cost overruns and stalled projects.

Although Los Angeles continues to remain an attractive destination for foreign capital, these complexities have steered overseas developers to other global cities such as London and Melbourne, where the development process is less cumbersome.
<h4><strong>Public Sector + Institutional Development Activity</strong></h4>
Many of the major public-sector projects in Los Angeles County are focused on either upgrading aging facilities or preparing the County to host the 2028 Olympics, with multiple public agencies and institutions making a concerted effort to transform the city’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. As of June 2018, there are nearly 20 major public-sector/institutional projects or programs in the pipeline including:

<iframe class="airtable-embed" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="https://airtable.com/embed/shra47t2UWfsRnnrV?backgroundColor=gray&amp;viewControls=on" width="100%" height="533" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Partnerships and M&amp;As Formed To Tackle Mega Projects</strong></h5>
The ongoing transformation of the County has resulted in several billion-dollar mega-projects that have required companies to join forces in order to compete and deliver on. These projects include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/bos/supdocs/118722.pdf"><strong>Harbor-UCLA Medical Center Campus</strong> </a>- A pre-planning exercise which will pave the way for a major master plan project at the 72-acre campus. A JV team led by AECOM includes JGM, Citadel CPM, and Jensen + Partners.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.airportrevenuenews.com/p3-contract-lax-automated-people-mover/">LAX Automated People Mover</a> </strong>- A $4.8 billion a public-private-partnership project designed to shuttle travelers to and from LAX more efficiently. LAWA entered a 30-year contract with LINXS, an integrated team consisting of Fluor, Balfour Beatty, ACS, Dragados, Hochtief, Flatiron, HDR, HNTB, and Bombardier Transportation.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-airport-concourse-20141219-story.html">LAX Midfield Concourse</a> </strong>– A $1.25 billion expansion planned to add 11 passenger gates to the airport by 2020. LAWA awarded the design and construction contract to a JV between Turner and PCL.</li>
</ul>
In addition to joint-ventures and public-private-partnerships, a growing number of A/E/C firms are looking towards mergers and acquisitions as a key strategy to position themselves for both the specialty and integrated services demanded by large infrastructure projects.

In Q1 2018, California led the nation in the number of M&amp;A deals. According to Morrissey Goodale, <a href="http://morrisseygoodale.com/management-solutions/merger-acquisition-advisory/2018-aec-ma-q1-commentary/">California saw a total of 13 M&amp;A deals in Q1 2018</a> involving A+E firms, with 10 deals involving firms ranked on ENR’s Top 500 Design Firms list including Tetra Tech (ENR #5), NV5 (ENR #54), CannonDesign (ENR #79), HBK Engineering (ENR #220), EnSafe (ENR #222), Salas O’Brien (ENR #232) (two deals), Advantage Engineers (ENR #425), Steinberg Hart (ENR #440), and DAHLIN Group (ENR #487).
<h4><strong>Impact On Construction Costs</strong></h4>
Construction cost indices such as the <a href="https://www.enr.com/economics">ENR Building Cost Index (ENR BCI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/resd/PMB/CCCI/Old/cccitable_2018/CCCIMasterListing_4-2018.pdf">California Construction Cost Index (CCCI)</a> offer useful benchmarks when estimating project budgets. However, Owners should take care to update their calculations as the indices update, or better yet, reconcile their projections with actual cost data from recent comparable projects.

In markets as dynamic as Los Angeles, it is not uncommon for indices to be outpaced by real-time costs by the time the project breaks ground, especially among larger, more complex institutional works. The CCCI for instance, is a popular index routinely used by major regional agencies and institutions such as the California State University (CSU) and Judicial Council of California (JCC) to set budgets for their future capital programs. The CCCI reported an annual construction cost increase of 4.4% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017. In our experience, however, real-time <strong><u>construction costs increased by 6-8% per annum</u></strong> over that 2 year period.

Uncertainty around the recent steel tariff has also contributed to greater risk around construction costs. This may be further compounded by the recent extension of the Tariff to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-the-european-union-canada-and-mexico/2018/05/31/891bb452-64d3-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cfaf46853792">now include Mexico, Canada, and the European Union</a>. Although the tariff has broad implications across the US steel industry and steel-framed structures, the actual direct cost impact on projects will, in most cases, still be less than 1%.

&nbsp;
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/the-steel-tariff-and-construction-cost-putting-it-into-context/">Read our analysis on the construction cost impact of the steel tariff here.</a></strong></h5>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Putting It Into Context </strong></h4>
Moving forward, the current volume of construction activity is expected to remain strong over the next 18-24 months. As many major projects near planned completion in 2020, the tension between demand and supply of skilled labor and key materials will become less pronounced. The general consensus is that the market will begin to level off in 2020.

We are also of the opinion that the market is moving into the latter stages of what tends to be a historical cycle of activity that ebbs and flows over 5-10 year durations. The current cycle of increased investment, construction activities, and costs began in 2013, putting us in the fifth year of continued and rapid growth.

The other factor to consider is how are projects being procured both now and in the future.  The current trend is heavily weighted towards early and continued engagement of the general contractor or construction manager during the design phase through either design-build, Construction Management-At-Risk (CMAR), Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), or other variations of these selection methods. On many projects this practice is also being extended to design-assist strategies for major trades such as curtainwall, MEP, and elevators.

While this brings benefits to the Owner relative to constructability input during design, it can lead to a less competitive climate as Owners lock in contractors and subcontractors through negotiation or limited bidding.  While it seems unlikely that the market will revert back to the “not so traditional anymore” hard bidding environment, it will be important for Owners to evaluate their options for procurement and to ensure that their budgeting reflects their preferred or selected strategy.

A number of our clients are asking about all of this relative to planned projects and how best to set budgets in today's market that are still realistic knowing that they may not break ground for 3-4 years.  Our advice to them is to be cautious but not overly conservative in budget planning.

The rising cost of construction over the past couple of years is unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term and when the market does re-adjust it will lead to improved competition at the trade level. In anticipation of this we are recommending that escalation factors should be dialed back to a more historical average of around 3.0% to 4.0% per annum when planning for investment in 2020 and beyond.

MGAC will continue to track this over the short-term and provide updates as further data is gathered and analyzed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Navigating through building permitting systems can be a challenging and time-consuming process. As Owner’s Representatives, we are continuously guiding our projects through such systems, with building types ranging from hotels, office, multi-family, to high-end private residences. In Washington DC, securing a building permit often requires 5 months or more, so managing this process correctly has been a critical part of our project success.

Over the last few years, several factors including a <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/2017-2018-construction-market-report-washington-d-c-metro-region/">booming construction market</a>, a revised zoning code, and the adoption of “Green” building standards have created an increasingly difficult environment for owners and developers not familiar with the permitting process in DC.

This paper provides an overview of our group’s collective knowledge of the permitting process in DC, with contributions from <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/harold-bingham/12">Harold Bingham</a>, who is involved on a wide range of commercial, residential, and institutional projects across the District, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/dermot-ryan/45">Dermot Ryan</a>, who leads MGAC’s Hospitality Project Management Group, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/michael-lee/31">Michael Lee</a>, who is overseeing the historic L’Enfant Plaza Hotel and W Washington DC renovations, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42">Mark Anderson</a>, the Founder and President MGAC, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mimi-toner/32">Mimi Toner</a>, who is managing the renovation of an estate-quality residence.
<h4>The Permitting Process</h4>
Applying for a building permit in DC involves an <a href="https://dcra.dc.gov/node/1234411">online submittal</a> to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for review and approval from all relevant agencies. We created this flow chart of the building permitting process as a tool for our Project Managers:

<img class="size-large wp-image-2403 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DC-Permitting-Process-Chart-1024x768.png" alt="Flow chart showing illustrating the DC permitting process" width="1024" height="768" />

It pays to spend the time upfront ensuring that your permit application and drawings are as complete as possible before submitting. Applications can incur multiple rounds of reviews by multiple agencies until the plan receives all required approvals. Only after all relevant agencies have reviewed and approved will DCRA issue the building permit.

Remember that design changes following the issuance of a building permit may result in additional plan checks before progress can be inspected. In certain cases where significant (such as structural related) design changes have been made, the project may be required to restart the permitting process from the beginning.

For more information and links on the permitting process, see our Additional Resources section at the end of this paper.
<h4><strong>Which Agencies Are Involved In The Permitting Process?</strong></h4>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">DCRA</strong></h5>
Arguably the single most important agency in the permitting process is the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA), the primary permitting agency for Washington DC.

As the only agency authorized to issue permits, DCRA plays a key role in the permitting process. But like other permitting agencies in other cities with busy construction markets, DCRA grapples with the issue of limited resources relative to their processing workload.

Over the last five years, permit volume has grown by over 30%, but the number of permit reviewers has not seen a corresponding increase. While it is still unclear how DCRA plans to overcome these challenges moving forward, the agency has explored a number of options to streamline their process over the past year including new permitting programs <em>(See Evaluation of Other Permitting Routes below)</em>, performance management programs, and restructuring.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Other Review Agencies</strong></h5>
According to DCRA, 57% of building permits require reviews from more than one agency. Although DCRA is the primary permit issuance agency, other agencies will be involved in the review process before the application even reaches DCRA. Common project types that will require review from additional agencies include: New-build, Additions, Restaurants, Excavation, and Historic district locations.

A building permit is issued only after the project has met all the standards required by the relevant disciplines. Unfortunately, there is currently no central tracking system that consolidates updates from all involved agencies.

The following chart summarizes the review disciplines for the involved agencies:

<img class="size-large wp-image-2402 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DC-Permitting-Agencies-1024x768.png" alt="MGAC DC Permitting Review Agencies" width="1024" height="768" />

One unique factor to consider in DC is the involvement of the US Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), which is charged with overseeing both public <em>and</em> private projects that involve changes to <em>“exterior architectural features, height, appearance, color, and texture of the materials of exterior construction”</em> that are visible from public spaces.

The CFA operates in conjunction with the Historic Preservation Office (HPO) and the Historic Preservation Review Board (HPRB) to ensure that <a href="https://cic.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/op/publication/attachments/Commission%2520of%2520Fire%2520Arts%2520Review.pdf">historic character is preserved in all Federal and District of Columbia government projects and two designated neighborhoods</a> - the Georgetown Historic District, and Shipstead-Luce Area.

Any project with exterior alterations meeting these criteria will need to be reviewed by the CFA, HPO, and/or the HPRB.
<h4><strong>How Long Does It Take to Get A Building Permit in D.C?</strong></h4>
Perhaps the question that concerns owners and developers the most is how long it takes to obtain a construction permit.

Although permit processing times can vary significantly depending on project, the issuance time for an addition, alteration, or repair construction permit averages five months, according to DCRA. In practice, however, we’ve experienced permit processing times of up to six months for a standard commercial interior demolition job.

For a new build construction permit, DCRA reports an average issuance time of just under 6 months. In our experience, we’ve found that commercial new build permits tend to require more time and generally allot a <em>minimum</em> of 6 months for the process.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2404 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DC-Permit-Issuance-Times.png" alt="DC Construction Permit Issuance Times - MGAC" width="942" height="581" />

This situation is not unique to Washington DC. Other cities with booming construction markets also experience similarly long permit processing times. Seattle for example, which is one of the <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/seattle-crane-count-falls-still-leads-nation/516108/">busiest construction market</a> in the nation, currently averages 8 months for a new build construction permit.

As a general best practice, but especially in these types of markets, engaging relevant agencies early and keeping them involved throughout the project can help facilitate a much smoother permitting process.
<h4><strong>Challenges</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>What Factors Can Extend Permit Processing Time In DC?</strong></h5>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Involvement of Multiple Agencies</strong></h5>
The involvement of multiple agencies is one of the main factors in a longer-than-expected permit processing time.

The 2016 Permit Issues Study published by the Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) revealed that <a href="https://www.aiadc.com/sites/default/files/AIADC%20Testimony%20on%20Bill%20B22-0669%20proposed%20Department%20of%20Building%20Act.pdf">75% of respondents saw longer</a> permitting times when the review process involved the DOEE and DDOT.

In our experience as well, projects with public space components such as outdoor patios or curb cuts tend to have longer permitting times. These types of projects not only require a public space permit from DDOT, which stipulates very specific traffic control rules that can limit construction, but are also frequently subject to more public input and oversight into the process, which can impede a project’s schedule.

For commercial developments in particular, projects can be required to run through a series of local and Federal agencies for plan review, depending on a number of factors including project complexity, scope, and zoning.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Multiple Review Cycles</strong></h5>
During the permitting process, multiple rounds of review may be required due to errors or omissions in the application package. According to DCRA, 53% of plans submitted in 2016 required 2 or more reviews, including:
<ul>
 	<li>10% requiring a third green review</li>
 	<li>9% requiring a third structural review</li>
 	<li>9% requiring a third zoning review</li>
</ul>
Changes in regulation, such as the implementation of the <a href="http://handbook.dcoz.dc.gov/">2016 Zoning Code</a> and the <a href="https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/2-1226.36.html">DC Stormwater Management code</a> have compounded this issue, as both applicants and agencies must work to understand and enforce these new laws.

In an effort to reduce the number of review cycles, DCRA now requires the applicant and team members to <a href="https://dcra.dc.gov/page/about-permits">participate in a mandatory meeting to address project specifics</a> if the plan has been held for corrections after the second review cycle.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2432 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DC-Review-Cycles-Permit-Chart-1-1024x768.png" alt="DC Number of Review Cycles Required to Proceed - MGAC" width="1024" height="768" />

But this complex permitting process and lengthy process continues to face sharp criticism. To address the issue, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson introduced legislation in January 2018 that proposes <a href="https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/housing-complex/blog/20989708/should-dcra-be-broken-up-a-majority-of-the-dc-council-thinks-so">restructuring DCRA into two separate agencies</a>, known as the Department of Buildings and the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection, with the former focusing on the enforcement of building related codes. Even if approved, the legislation would not be implemented until around 2019.

In our experience, hiring an architect with extensive local experience is one of the most effective methods for minimizing the potential of multiple review cycles. An experienced architect will have a thorough understanding of local code and deliver complete and compliant drawings that will help simplify the review process.
<h4><strong>Evaluation of Permit Expediting Routes</strong></h4>
There are three routes to potentially expedite the permitting process. It’s important to note, however, that none of these routes are guaranteed to expedite the permitting process and that care should be taken to select (or avoid) the service that is right for your situation.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Permit Expeditors</strong></h5>
Permit expeditors are firms that are familiar with the permit submission and review process and requirements at DCRA, and typically have established reputations and relationships with individuals at relevant agencies.

The highly specialized expertise that expeditors offer can be invaluable for moving the process along, especially in DC where the process is complicated and lengthy. We have worked with multiple permit expeditors over the years and would recommend engaging an expeditor if you are considering building in DC for the first time.

Contact us for recommendations on specific expeditors.
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Third-Party Review Program</strong></h5>
The third-party review program was created in response to the District’s large volume of development applications. The program is designed to expedite the review process by augmenting DCRA staff with <a href="https://dcra.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcra/publication/attachments/2017-2018_Approved_Third_PArty_Agencies_%28November%202017%29.pdf">DCRA certified third-party companies</a>. Fees will vary depending on size and scope of the project.

Rather than waiting in a queue at the DCRA, owners can hire these approved third parties to perform plan reviews. Ideally, an approved permit would be issued shortly after the plans are reviewed and approved by the DCRA-certified reviewers.

In practice, utilizing a third-party reviewer may not necessarily yield improvements in speed, and in certain cases, can slow the process even further. Two main reasons include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Zoning</strong> – Zoning is typically the most time-consuming discipline but can only be reviewed by DCRA, which means that all applications must be routed through the agency at some point during the review process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Re-review</strong> - DCRA will re-review a percentage of the plans already reviewed by the third-party companies as part of their quality control process. If any changes are required, they will then need to be reviewed by the third-party again before submitting back to DCRA.</li>
</ul>
In the 2016 Permit Issues Study by the Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), 60% of respondents reported that they have not used the Third-Party Review Program. Among the 40% that have used Third-Party Review Program, 68% reported no improvements in permit processing times.

In our experience, third-party reviewers are best reserved for complex projects, as they are willing to sit down and take the time to understand your project across all disciplines. This extra set of eyes and expertise can be the difference between approvals in the first round or going through multiple rounds of re-reviews.<strong> </strong>
<h5><strong style="color: #0095c3;">Fast-Track Plan Review Program (Velocity or Expedition)</strong></h5>
The Fast-Track Plan Review Program was originally an <a href="https://dc.curbed.com/2018/4/5/17202556/velocity-dc-building-permit-dcra">emergency program</a> instituted in September 2017 and meant to expire in January 2018. This program has since been extended indefinitely and is designed to speed up the permit review process by offering two routes for fast-tracked approvals:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Velocity Service</strong> - Designed for permit applicants whose design concepts and plans are 100% complete.</li>
 	<li><strong>Expedited Service</strong> - Designed for applicants whose plans are still in the design phase.</li>
</ul>
To participate in either program, applicants are required to first attend a project consultation session in-person, over the phone, or via web conference. Then, the applicant will file their permit applications online and upload documents into DCRA’s database. After the DCRA Coordinator approves the project for fast-tracking and the applicant pays a $5,000 non-refundable deposit, the applicant and the design team can move forward to a mandatory pre-submittal meeting and several rounds of plan review sessions. At the conclusion of the plan review sessions, the plan will be approved by DCRA and permit issued. More details of the process can be found <u><a href="https://eservices.dcra.dc.gov/DocumentManagementSystem/Home/retrieve?id=Velocity%20Program%20Overview.pdf">here</a></u>.

The Fast-Track Program can add tens of thousands of dollars to the standard permit costs. Below is the fee schedule published by DCRA:

<img class="size-full wp-image-2406 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DC-Velocity-Program.png" alt="DCRA Velocity and Expedition Program Service Fees - MGAC" width="882" height="313" />

It may be too soon to draw any conclusions about these programs so far. However, the AIA DC has <u><a href="https://www.aiadc.com/sites/default/files/AIADC%20Testimony%20on%20Bill%20B22-0669%20proposed%20Department%20of%20Building%20Act.pdf">voiced its concern</a></u> in its testimony before the City Council that even with the fast-track program, it might still take months to get a permit as DCRA can’t guarantee that other agencies will also respond in a timely fashion. The program is also facing public criticism.
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
Although DCRA and other review agencies are continuing to explore new programs and structures to streamline the permitting process in Washington DC, the route to a fully permitted project in the District is likely to remain a complicated affair in the near term.

As we saw earlier, there are many factors in the permitting process that are out of the developer’s or owner’s control. There is simply no definitive formula to expedite the process.

Rather, the goal is to minimize unnecessary roadblocks and re-reviews by understanding which agencies will be required to review your specific project and where potential bottlenecks may lie. From this, an owner can deploy the right consultants to prepare the most accurate and complete application package and select the right permitting route for your unique timing and situation.

Experienced Project Managers can help navigate through this process by defining a realistic schedule for your project, assembling the right team of consultants, and leveraging relationships with relevant agencies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Default">What could be a more inspiring place for middle schoolers to learn than a central location in Washington, DC? MGAC was recently tasked with renovating Eliot-Hine, a middle school situated just outside of capitol hill. MGAC’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meg-davis-45a55531/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg Davis</a> is leading the project, providing project management and owners representation for the Department of General Services (DGS), who oversees DC schools, parks, and recreation among others. <a href="http://www.turnerconstruction.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turner Construction</a> will serve as general contractors for the project.</p>
<p class="Default">The two year renovation begins this summer and is slated for completion in the 2020/2021 school year. Renovations will allow its 480 students to continue learning on-site, even with the dawn of a new school year come September. When complete, the Eliot-Hine renovation will restore the historic school building to its former glory while adding new, light-filled spaces for students to gather, socialize, and marvel at their surroundings. Eliot-Hine was built in 1931, and throughout its nearly 90-year existence has been altered to accommodate its growing student body. As a result, the school is overdue for thoughtful and strategic updates that better suit the needs of current students and parents.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2460 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_3527.jpg" alt="" width="2016" height="1512" />
<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Eliot-Hine’s main schoolhouse was built and occupied first, soon joined by an annex space in 1936. Both will stay in tact during renovations. The school introduced two additional wings onto the building in the 1960’s, which will be removed and reimagined in this process. This piece is critical to removing “dead ends” within hallways and buildings, ultimately allowing for smooth and direct pathways for students and teachers to walk each day and to encourage connectivity and interaction throughout the campus.</span></p>
<p class="Default">Eliot-Hine faces Capitol Hill - but you’d not currently realize this from the inside. Through the renovation, a new entrance and courtyard along 18th Street will be added, along with a glass encased gymnasium to showcase its exceptional neighborhood views. The driving factor behind the new design by architect Perkins Eastman, is both the need and desire for students to gather in “<span lang="IT">non academic settings</span>” for more casual socialization and camaraderie something regularly addressed in the School Improvement Team (SIT) which is comprised of parents, staff, and community members. The renovated school will provide a far more open and welcoming environment for students, teachers and the community at large. It is also expected to meet sustainability guidelines for LEED Gold certification.</p>
<p class="Default">Keeping the school’s historical aspects in tact are critical. The Commission of Fine Arts and Historic Preservation Office provided recommendations for restoring and preserving its special elements, which included original crown molding in the auditorium and wood trim, the exposure of a 1930’s plaster ceiling (long covered by another surface), and the preservation of the lobby’s terrazzo floors.</p>
<p class="Default">Since beginning work on Eliot-Hine, MGAC was thrilled to have also been assigned additional DC schools in need of renovation. Work will begin in 2019. Eliot Hine is not the first school renovation project in MGAC’s portfolio. Davis and her team recently led the renovation of Episcopal High School, winning an Excellence in Construction Awards award for the historic restoration category for the renovation of the gymnasium of this beloved boarding school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last ten years, the EB-5 Program has emerged as an extremely popular but widely misunderstood alternative financing method for commercial real estate development. Although the EB-5 Program has incurred a somewhat negative reputation in recent years, this has mostly been due to a handful of high-profile fraudulent EB-5 schemes. In reality, EB-5 continues to be an attractive financing option for commercial real estate developers who understand its intricacies, especially as the industry continues to implement reforms.

This article is intended to examine trends when deploying EB-5 capital, clarify misperceptions surrounding the EB-5 Program, and explore the future of the EB-5 industry. In analyzing the outlook of the EB-5 Program, we consider new regulatory reform as well as the rise of third party consultants who can help improve accountability and efficiency to the EB-5 financing Process.

We extend a special thanks to Young Kim, Managing Director of<a href="https://8thbridgecap.com/"> 8<sup>th</sup> Bridge Capital</a>, an LA based investment management firm specializing in Asian EB-5 and private equity funding, for his contribution.
<h4><strong>Overview of EB-5 In Commercial Real Estate Development</strong></h4>
The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/about-eb-5-visa-classification">EB-5 Program</a> is a USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) employment-based visa program allowing foreign investors to gain permanent residency through a $500,000–$1,000,000 investment in a new commercial enterprise that creates at least 10 full-time jobs.

Although the EB-5 Program was formed in 1990, it remained in relative obscurity until the economic recovery that followed the 2008 financial crisis. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.abil.com/articles/USCIS%20Clarifies%20Key%20Aspects%20of%20EB-5%20Program%20(Yale-Loehr).pdf">USCIS ruled that construction jobs</a> created from EB-5 funded developments would fulfill the program’s job-creation requirement. This catapulted EB-5 into the mainstream as a viable funding option for commercial real estate developers. In 2010, less than 2,000 visas were issued through the EB-5 program, but by 2014, that number had reached its annual USCIS-mandated maximum of approximately 10,000 visas.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2484 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Top-10-EB5-Countries-2017-MGAC-1024x768.jpg" alt="Map of Top 10 EB5 Investor Countries in 2017 - MGAC" width="1024" height="768" />

<em>Over <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2017AnnualReport/FY17AnnualReport%20-TableV-PartIII.pdf">75% of EB-5 visas issued in 2017 </a></em><em>were issued to Chinese investors. China and Vietnam are now the two most popular countries for EB-5, and currently the only 2 that have a visa backlog due to over-subscription.</em>

Today, commercial real estate developments attract the lion’s share of EB-5 funding. One of the primary forces driving the growth in EB-5 real estate investment was the improved accessibility to funds that<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/immigrant-investor-regional-centers"> regional centers</a> offered.

Regional centers now account for over 90% of all EB-5 projects, but some have begun to face criticism for lack of transparency in recent years. Several regional centers, for instance, have been formed by real estate developers in order to secure funding for their own developments, resulting in a potential conflict of interest in which the project developer is acting as both the borrower and the lender. These types of issues have prompted the USCIS to begin implementing reforms aimed at improving the transparency of the EB-5 process.
<h4><strong>Most Popular Project Types Among EB-5 Investors</strong></h4>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img class="wp-image-2510 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1280px-CenturyPlazaHotel-MGAC-1024x768.jpg" alt="Century Plaza Hotel Before Renovations" width="1024" height="768" /></h4>
<em>Century Plaza, a major $1B expansion and renovation project in LA with condo, retail, and hotel components was partially financed with EB-5 funding. MGAC </em><em>is providing independent cost consulting services to the owner.</em>

Foreign EB-5 investors have a strong preference for commercial real estate projects because of the transparency and consistent demand of the market, as well as the expectation that their investments will be secured by a tangible asset. It is important to remember that EB-5 investors are primarily concerned with satisfying the program’s requirements and gaining permanent residency status, rather than maximizing return on investment. Thus, EB-5 funding is characteristically risk-averse and gravitates towards the safest potential projects with the highest likelihood of successful completion.

According to Young Kim, who spends nearly half of his time in Asia with prospective EB-5 investors, investors are attracted to projects that have:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Gateway City Locations - </strong>EB-5 projects concentrate in coastal “gateway” cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Washington DC, and San Francisco. Foreign investors have more experience and exposure to these large coastal cities and regard them as safe, desirable destinations for investment. This parallels trends for non-EB-5 foreign investment in US real estate.</li><br />
 	<li><strong>Condominium or Commercial Office Components –</strong> According to Kim, <em>“In the past, developments in the hospitality sector were most common. However, EB-5 funding is moving towards the condominium and office space sectors as these developments are currently easier to offload upon completion.”</em></li><br />
 	<li><strong>$100-250 Million Total Project Cost –</strong> In order to leverage projects sensibly, EB-5 funding will normally fall within a “sweet spot” of 20-30% of  a project’s total capital stack either in the form of mezzanine debt or equity. <em>“A 20-30% EB-5 financing piece,”</em> says Kim “<em>is not only attractive to investors, who want to avoid overleveraged projects, but also easier to fund in a more predictable timeline. We’ve found that a $20-75 million EB-5 raise [20-30% on a $100-250 million project] is more manageable given that the two largest EB-5 markets, China and Vietnam, have slowed down in recent months.” </em><br />
Another consideration is the job requirements of EB-5 funding. Depending on the asset types being developed, there may only be enough eligible jobs created by the project to raise up to 20-30%. According to Kim “<em>Condominium developments tend to create less jobs for any given investment amount, while hotels tend to create more jobs for the same amount”</em></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Misperceptions When Deploying EB-5 Funding</strong></h4>
Although the EB-5 program has attracted increasing attention and demand, many US developers still have an incomplete or outdated understanding of the program as a whole. EB-5 is unique compared to other traditional sources of funding, and brings with it a special set of benefits and limitations. Some of the most common misperceptions in the market are:
<h5><strong>EB-5 Is Just An Immigration Product</strong></h5>
Many developers focus on the program’s immigration feature, while failing to understand the full scope of hurdles involved with the investment process. In reality, EB-5 is considered a security and is regulated as such. Immigration is just one aspect of the EB-5 program, and is accompanied by complex financial features that require very specific financial preparation. Often, developers only seek immigration attorneys, when experienced securities attorneys are also necessary to successfully navigate the EB-5 process.
<h5><strong>EB-5 Is Fast Money </strong></h5>
Some developers believe that EB-5 offers a relatively quick way to attain funding when compared to other lending sources. The fact is that EB-5 is “slow money”, both in terms of disbursement and maturity time, meaning that it is not suitable for all types of projects or developers.

It is possible to use EB-5 funding at the beginning of a project, but this can unnecessarily complicate the project’s capital stack. The project will likely require bridge financing during the period in which the EB-5 funds are being raised as the program typically requires funds to be consolidated, processed, and disbursed.

More commonly, developers will incorporate EB-5 funding when construction of the project is already underway. In this strategy, EB-5 funding is used to refinance more expensive construction loans, partially replacing the fully capitalized developer’s equity with cheaper, long-term EB-5 funding. <em>“In most cases, following this strategy can help lower the overall cost of capital to 6 or 7%” </em>says Kim.

EB-5 funding has traditionally been used with a 5-year investment timeline. However, with mandated “waiting lists”, some countries now require longer investment periods<em>. “Specifically, the Chinese timeline has grown from about 5 years to around 10-15 years, while the Vietnamese timeline now averages around 7 years.”</em> However, Kim goes on to explain, <em>“Developers can use this long timeline to their advantage. They might propose projects with longer timelines when they know they are targeting Chinese or Vietnamese investors.”</em>
<h5><strong>EB-5 Is Free Money</strong></h5>
Although EB-5 is relatively affordable when compared with traditional forms of financing, there are still costs due to the unique nature of EB-5. While it is true that EB-5 interest rates are rising as it becomes more popular, these rates will likely remain below 10%, which still makes it an attractive form of financing. In using EB-5, developers can fix their interest rate at the time of funding to hedge against inflation.

Foreign governments’ restrictions and other issues with transferring funds across borders can complicate the EB-5 process and increase the cost of capital. In countries with capital controls such as China or Vietnam, foreign brokers are often necessary to move funds out of the country - a risky process that comes with relatively high transaction fees.
<h4><strong>The Future of EB-5: Greater Transparency</strong></h4>
Considering the popularity of the EB-5 Program, regulation and enforcement within the industry has been surprisingly hazy. One such area of uncertainty is the issue of redeployment: the process of reinvesting the capital of investors whose immigration petitions are still pending. For countries with significant backlogs such as China, investors must have their investments "at risk" while their immigration petitions are awaiting approval - a process that can add an additional 5 to 10 years onto the 5-year period most real estate development projects require capital for. In the past, regional centers and EB-5 fund managers have only written loose language around how redeployments will be handled. But as the first wave of redeployment nears, the USCIS has begun to have discussions around implementing more concrete guidelines.

More reform and regulation are being implemented as the program matures. The USCIS has recently mandated several Integrity Measures for the EB-5 Program to improve accountability. These include conducting random <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-regional-center-compliance-reviews">audits of Regional Centers</a> and requiring more comprehensive documentation and transparency for Regional Center activities and foreign investors.

<em>Independent fund managers and loan monitors can offer improved transparency and risk management to the EB-5 process.</em>

Beyond improvements in USCIS regulation, the industry is taking internal steps to improve transparency. Some foreign investors are starting to look outside of regional centers to independent third-party players consultants to structure, manage, and monitor their EB-5 investments. Independent investment managers are neither limited to projects in certain geographic regions nor restricted to projects with certain developers. Consequently, these independent investment managers can help mitigate potential issues arising from conflicts of interest while offering the widest selection of investment opportunities. Some third-party consultants come from backgrounds in commercial banking and can provide an institutional-grade due diligence and risk management process when sourcing and structuring investment opportunities.

Construction loan monitors provide another opportunity to improve risk management by complementing the Lenders’ expertise in financing and structuring. At MGAC, our lender services team can work closely with regional centers or independent fund managers to provide detailed, extensive oversight of the development process. Our team reviews various reports to confirm work is being completed in accordance with approved plans, specifications, budgets, local regulations and applicable Building Code.
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
At MGAC, our Lender Services team has been tracking the evolution of the EB-5 industry with great interest. Moving forward, we believe it will be essential for regulators, developers, investment managers, and construction monitoring specialists to collaborate in order to push greater accountability and transparency throughout the industry. EB-5 financing is a complex process that requires the synchronization of various moving parts in order to succeed. Despite the various challenges, hurdles, and interests competing through the entire process, EB-5 funding can still be an attractive source of funding for the right project type.

Led by MGAC Senior Project Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhakemi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Hakemi</a>, our Canadian project team has just surpassed the midway mark for project management on a substantial portion of the MUN’s multi-year infrastructure renewal plan.</p>
<p class="Default">Through this partnership, MGAC’s primary focus is overseeing the replacement of the core elements of an aging portion of the science and chemistry building, part of Faculty of Science, and expanding the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences. MUN’s ultimate goal is to leverage these improvements to attract researchers, lead new research initiatives, and increase student enrollment.</p>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-2525 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/44367615001_3d7c697817_k-1.jpg" alt="" width="1910" height="769" />As described by MUN, the 480,000-square-foot space is earmarked for teaching and research laboratories, associated offices, and other shelled-in space reserved for future partner build-out. The research and teaching space will be occupied primarily by the Departments of Biochemistry, Biology and Chemistry in the Faculty of Science, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.
<p class="Default">Labs from the Core Research Equipment and Instrument Training (CREAIT) Network of MUN will occupy highly specialized and sophisticated research labs. One of the most notable being the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technology lab, which will be part of the “Science on Display” concept adopted by the CSF project. The CSF building will also house MUN’s Cryogenic Facility, which produces liquid nitrogen and helium.  The new “shell spaces” will provide 148,000-square feet for research partnerships with likeminded organizations and universities - the Ocean Frontier Institute was the first to commit. The project is scheduled for completion in 2020 and <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L0nNIOrV3k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live updates</a> </span><span class="None">are regularly shared by the University.</span></p>

<p class="Default"><span class="None">The CSF’s unlikely design inspiration? Icebergs, which are regular visitors from the Arctic to the island during summer months. Large, majestic, and not entirely visible (in fact, nearly 80% of icebergs remain underwater), icebergs draw many similarities to the Core Science building. The work, research, and technology performed and developed here are largely invisible to the public, but are immensely important and impactful.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span class="None">Samuel joined MGAC in January 2014 to oversee MGAC’s Canadian outpost (initially established in 2013), but in December 2017 was joined by a handful of new team members.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[September 2018 marks the 113th month of continued economic expansion in the US. This period of growth, which began in March 2009, has been underway for over 9 years and is the second longest cycle in our nation’s history (following the 120 months from 1991-2001). Although the economy remains strong by many measures and is sitting at or near historical peaks, there is increasing discussion about the next recession.

As an owner’s representative and construction cost consultancy, our clients come to us for advice on managing uncertainty, risks, and budget for their projects, particularly large-scale or long-term capital work that can extend five or more years. This report reviews the economic and construction indicators we are actively monitoring to anticipate and prepare for a potential economic shift. The indicators we analyzed are national level indicators, which average and smooth out regional variations.

Our analysis shows continued expansion on nearly all fronts but with growth slowing compared to previous years. Low unemployment and stock market highs, coupled with strong consumer sentiment are all positives, while the flattening yield curve, oversupply in the multi-family residential sector, and the lack of momentum in new housing starts are negative indicators. Uncertainty around the current political climate and trade conflicts also weigh on the economy.

Historically, recessions have been triggered by external events that cause panic in financial markets, such as the 2000 tech bubble burst, and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. David Kotok, Chief Economist with Cumberland Advisors, reported that some businesses are already delaying investments amid the uncertainty, which could result in slower economic growth.

As in all recessions, some geographic areas will be hit earlier and harder than others. Cities with markets already operating over-capacity with stretched labor pools such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Seattle may be less affected than others, given the diversity and relative strength of their economies. Cities more tied to a specific industry, or without diversified business bases may face more severe contraction.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Signs-of-Recession-Potential-Impacts-on-the-US-Construction-Market-MGAC.pdf">Download The Full Report</a></strong></h4>
&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Positive Leading Indicators</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Construction Employment Remains Strong</strong></h4>
Changes in construction employment can be examined as an indicator of economic activity. Prior to a recession, the non-residential construction sector typically sheds workers, while the rest of the construction industry slows hiring.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe style="overflow: hidden;" src="//fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=liKO&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

As of July 2018, US construction employment has reached almost 7.2 million people, only 480,000 less (6%) less than the previous peak in 2007. Growth in the nonresidential sector has been slowing down while the growth in the residential sector has been rather volatile. It is difficult to flag any warning signs from employment figures at this point but considering the volatility that exists in residential sector numbers, we will be monitoring this indicator closely.
<h4><strong>Record-Breaking Stock Market Performance</strong></h4>
The stock market is now experiencing the longest Bull market in history. Numerous factors have contributed to this performance including low interest rates that have lowered the cost of investment and increased corporate profits, the lack of yield in fixed income investments that has flooded equity markets with capital, and the 2017 tax reform anticipated to improve corporate profits.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe style="overflow: hidden;" src="//fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=liK9&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<em>S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average market indices, which represent the diversified market as a whole, remain strong but have struggled to climb past their all-time highs in January of 2018. </em>

It is important to note that the stock market has generally acted as a pre-emptive indicator of fluctuations in the business cycle. Stock market declines have often preceded economic downturns, sometimes by more than a year. These occur when anticipation of an impending market contraction causes a rallying stock market to drop. With the speculative nature of equity investing and the growing use of options, negative indicators or signs can weaken investor confidence and have a ripple effect across the market, impacting corporate earnings and potentially triggering an economic downturn.

The yield curve mentioned earlier in this report is one of many such indicators that stock market investors watch closely. According to Derek Horstmeyer, Assistant Professor at George Mason University, <em>“…data suggest that prices (especially equities) </em><em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-investments-in-case-of-an-inverted-yield-curve-1536545041">respond much more to an [yield curve] inversion</a></em><em> than to an actual recession, which comes on average 12 months later”. </em>Recent and expected interest rate hikes by the Fed and the threat of trade restrictions such as the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/the-steel-tariff-and-construction-cost-putting-it-into-context/">steel tariff</a> are factors that are already threatening consumer and investor confidence moving forward.

The stock market is currently booming and the economy looks poised for growth, but MGAC will continue to track indicators including regulatory changes, corporate earnings trends, interest rate changes, and inflation.
<h3><strong>Neutral Leading Indicators</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Input and Output Construction Cost Index Spread Remains Stable</strong></h4>
ENR Building Cost Index (BCI) and Turner Construction Index (TCI) are two indices measuring input and output construction cost levels, respectively. The input cost index tracks the combined effect of material, labor, and equipment on construction costs, while the output index also accounts for the dynamics between market supply and demand, and bidding competitions. The spread between the two indices removes the effects of the inputs and can be used to gauge market conditions.

As the construction market expands, the spread between the two indices will widen as supply struggles to meet demand and contractors are able to charge a premium in a busy market. Conversely, the two indices tend to converge as the market cools due to lower margins among contractors as they compete for a shrinking pool of work. Additionally, in a heated construction market, labor quality suffers as a result of reduced productivity, which can perversely serve to suppress profitability in the busiest times. During a recession, the output index will fall far below the input index as contractors are willing to absorb a potential loss just to secure work.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2559 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Cost-Index-Spread-1024x612.png" alt="ENR BCI and Turner Construction Cost Index Spread MGAC" width="1024" height="612" />

As the market recovered from the previous recession, we can see that the output index surpassed the input index in mid-2012 and continued to spread until Q1 2016. After a period of narrowing from Q2 2016 to Q4 2017, the spread has resumed widening. We will continue to monitor these indices for a reversal of this trend.
<h4><strong>Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) Decreasing</strong></h4>
The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) releases The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), based on data it gathers from hundreds of manufacturing firms across the country. Using data from five different weighted factors including new orders, production, supplier deliveries, employment, and inventory levels, the PMI provides a health gauge for the economy as it tracks changes in the supply and demand conditions for the manufacturing sector. A PMI reading over 50 percent indicates that at half of manufacturers reported improvement in business over the previous month, while under 50 means the opposite.

In July 2018, the PMI was at 58.1 percent, equivalent to a decrease of 2.1 percentage points from June. The new orders index, production index, supplier deliveries index all declined slightly from June, signaling a slowing (but still growing) economy. Furthermore, the Prices index decreased from June, indicating higher prices for raw materials for the 29th consecutive month.

Overall, the July report suggested a weakening expansion in the manufacturing sector amid slowdown in new orders, export orders, and production. According to the ISM, the American manufacturing industry is still growing, however it is growing at a slower and slower pace. This slowing growth is due to a number of factors including new demand and supply reductions based on the escalating trade restrictions, shortages of skilled labor, higher costs for raw materials due to tariffs, and challenges with transportation of materials and inventories (also related to rising commodity prices and trade restrictions).
<h3><strong>Negative Leading Indicators</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Yield Curve Flattening</strong></h4>
The yield curve is an economic indicator that has predicted fluctuations in the economic cycle over the last several decades. Classically defined as the difference between two year and ten year debt instruments (usually Treasury bond yields), the yield curve has, over multiple economic cycles, been a reasonably reliable “canary in the coal mine” for economic activity, although a recent WSJ article worked to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-inverted-yield-curve-may-not-portend-doom-1532989421">dispel its relevance</a> when looked at over more than the last forty years.

Typically in periods of economic expansion, the yield curve slopes upward. This reflects the expectations of investors that future interest rates will be higher, indicative of greater levels of economic activity and central bank efforts to control price inflation. Conversely, an “inverted” yield curve is a situation in which long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates, indicative of market forces predicting that central bank actions to lower future interest rates will be necessary to spur greater economic activity. An inverted yield curve has preceded every recession in the past 40 years.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2558 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Yield-Curve-Inversions-1-1024x536.jpg" alt="Yield Curve Inversion Recession MGAC" width="1024" height="536" />

<em>Because the yield curve has inverted prior to every recession in the last 40 years, some believe it may help predict economic downturns.</em>

The yield curve is not currently inverted but it has steadily flattened since late 2013. While U.S. Treasury yields increased across all maturities, the yield curve was as close to flat as it has been since before the economic crisis began over 10 years ago. In fact, with razor-thin margins of less than 30 basis points between the yield on the 10-year and 2-year issues and just 12 points between the 30-year issue and 10-year note, inversion seems imminent.

The current trend of rising interest rates reflects the actions of the Federal Reserve to curb unsustainable expansion. The Fed most <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/13/619212907/interest-rates-expected-to-go-up-with-more-hikes-to-come">recently raised rates in June</a> and signaled that two additional increases are likely later this year. Recessions may result when the Fed raises rates too quickly or too high, a phenomenon called “over-tightening”, as higher rates cause significant decreases in investment and spending given the reduced affordability of debt, and potentially higher returns elsewhere. That said, we are currently in an environment of record low sustained interest rates, well below historical means. Our current, decade long period of ultra-low fixed income yields may truly mean “this time it really is different”.

MGAC will continue to follow changes in monetary policy to understand and anticipate the effects of these changes on investment, consumer spending, the construction market, and the economy.
<h4><strong>High Lender Exposure To Multi-Family</strong></h4>
US banks and other depository institutions have extended a <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG">steadily increasing amount of commercial real estate loans</a> each month since February 2013. In July 2018, CRE debt reached $2.1 trillion; a record amount exceeding the previous historical peak by 24%. A large volume of these outstanding loans is secured by multi-family residential projects. Fueled by record low interest rates and challenges in other real estate sectors over the last several years, developers pumped millions of units into the market in a relentless search for yield and profitable means of deploying capital and debt. This glut in urban cores has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-rental-rates-flatten-in-major-cities-as-supply-floods-market-1530097200">curbed multi-family rent growth</a>, which coupled with rising construction costs in major cities and increasingly expensive debt, may eventually lead to a significant market correction as investment yields become questionable.

According to the Fed’s July 2018 <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-201807.htm">Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices</a>, current lending standards among US banks are relatively tight, especially for CRE debt. But some banks are reporting otherwise, as competition among lenders seeking yield has increased. Chandler Howard, Chief Executive of Liberty Bank in Connecticut, reported there has been <em>“a rise in risky lending practices where “term sheets (are) coming through with interest-only transactions</em>”, and “<em>terms going out longer and longer, (with) some loosening in guarantees”</em>.
<h4><strong>Housing Market Losing Growth Momentum</strong></h4>
The housing market is a strong reflection of consumer confidence and a leading economic indicator. Homebuilders are reluctant to break ground on new projects if they fear the economy may slow, or if rising long term rates affect home affordability suppressing demand. Homebuyers are hesitant to invest in a new house if they expect the market to slide into a recession, or if interest rates on mortgage debt rise too far.
<h4><strong>Housing Starts Dropping</strong></h4>
Since 1960, every recession has been preceded by a double-digit decline in housing starts. The previous recession was considered to have officially started in Dec 2007, but housing starts exhibited a declining trend since early 2006. Although the peak level of housing starts in the current cycle remains far below historical peaks, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST">growth momentum for housing starts already appears to be waning.</a> Housing starts have hovered between 1.34 and 1.1 million per month since October 2016, most recently posting a 0.08% gain in July 2018 after a 12% drop from the previous month in June 2018.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe style="overflow: hidden;" src="//fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=liKq&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<h4><strong>Home Sales and Sales Prices Fall</strong></h4>
Existing home sales dropped in July 2018 for the fourth consecutive month, while housing inventory, which has consistently declined for years, has been growing since January 2018. Median sales prices for new houses sold remain at historical highs and posted a 5% bump in July 2018, but for have generally slid since November 2017. The lack of growth momentum in housing starts coupled with the decline of housing sales and prices, raise a sign of caution, especially as the economy moves into the late stage of its current cycle.
<h3><strong>Conclusion and Recommendations</strong></h3>
The range of factors and leading indicators that we are tracking all point toward continued, but waning growth, for the near term. Reports from many of our clients and contacts within the A/E/C industry are in line with our market analysis, with many reporting strong backlogs through 2019 but uncertainty beyond that. Many contractors are reporting lower profitability due to labor shortage, project delays, and diminished productivity from the labor force employed.

Optimism has slowly turned to caution over the last year as a myriad of unpredictable factors such as tariffs and trade agreement renegotiations have generated widespread uncertainty throughout the construction industry. Effectively managing uncertainty on a project requires not only a holistic understanding of the probabilities, patterns, and limits of the factors that can impact construction, but also experience and judgement to help set appropriate allowances including escalation, contingencies, and fluctuation clauses.

Based off our current data, we are continuing the project an escalation factor of 4% per year for the next two years. Beyond that, we are forecasting escalation to flatten based on our market analysis and research indicating a reduction of construction activities across the market. We will be monitoring these factors and market conditions and update our projections accordingly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Toronto construction market currently has a bright outlook supported by strong demand, heavy government-led growth and investment, and improving integration with the regional economy.

With population increases and demographic shifts acting as major development drivers, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will continue to densify with a rise in high-density housing and urban and suburban intensification.

Many of the firms we surveyed have reported a large volume of work across the GTA and beyond. Most firms are optimistic about the ability of the market to sustain growth, but rising construction costs remain a major concern among those in the industry.

Developers have been faced with rising material costs due to a host of economic and industry dynamics, adding to the continued challenge of finding skilled labour and feasible, buildable land.

The future of the area’s continued growth will largely hinge on the market’s ability to manage these “side-effects” of sustained growth.

We hope you find this snapshot of the Toronto market interesting; in our upcoming Toronto construction market report, we will explore the cost implications of these conditions in further detail.

Special thanks to Mansoor Kazerouni and Andrea Katz of <a href="https://www.ibigroup.com/">IBI Group</a>, a global technology driven infrastructure, architecture, engineering, and planning firm based in Toronto, for their contributions and insights to this report.

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>At A Glance</strong></h4>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2597 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Toronto-GDP-Construction-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />
<ul>
 	<li>Canada’s construction industry continues to recover from the 2015 recession that was largely caused by a sharp decline in oil prices. The annualized construction GDP has resumed its steady track of growth and is forecasted to expand by <a href="http://www.oecd.org/economy/canada-economic-forecast-summary.htm">2% from mid-2018</a></li>
 	<li>Canada is home to the <a href="https://www.thebig5hub.com/galleries/top-10-world-s-largest-construction-markets-in-2020/">fifth largest construction market</a> in the world, surpassed only by Japan (#4), India (#3), US (#2), and China (#1). The construction industry accounts for over 7% of Canada’s national GDP and employs 1 of every 14 working Canadians.</li>
 	<li>Toronto is experiencing the largest amount of construction activity of any city in Canada. The city was recently reported to have the <a href="http://assets.rlb.com/production/2018/07/31172537/July-2018-Crane-Index.pdf">highest number of construction cranes</a> (97) across North America, beating out busy US construction markets including Seattle (65), Chicago (40), Los Angeles (36), Denver (28), San Francisco (26), and Washington DC (25).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Development Pipeline</strong></h4>
In Q1 2018, over 21% of the non-residential construction investments in Canada were in Toronto. The area’s sheer dollar amount of non-residential construction investment is not only consistently higher than other Canadian metropolitan area, but has also seen a steep growth since 2017, driven by the investments in the commercial, institutional, and public sector.

According to recent data collected by MGAC Research, the current development pipeline for the GTA contains over 800 private and public sector projects that are either under construction or in preconstruction; most developments are densely clustered in Downtown Toronto.

Density is a major theme of the GTA’s evolving landscape. In addition to the large number of ongoing developments currently in the GTA, numerous large-scale master plan exercises focused on both urban and suburban land use intensification are also underway. These plans include infill residential or mixed-use developments, suburban shopping centers, suburban park sites, and suburban office parks.

<em>"The volume of intensification studies that we currently have underway speak to the high demand for land in transit connected urban areas, and the desire to realize the latent value in these large tracts with huge development potential"</em> notes Mansoor Kazerouni, Global Director of Buildings at IBI Group.
<h4><strong>Development Analysis</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Permit Volume</strong></h5>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2594 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Toronto-Permit-by-Year-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

The number of major new-build/addition/alteration building permits - defined as permits valued at $20 million or more - has grown consistently over the last 5 years, peaking in 2017 with a dramatic 34% increase in the number of permits issued from 2016. This year, as of October 2018, the number of permits is on track to equal or exceed that of 2017.
<h5><strong>Building Types</strong></h5>
<img class="size-large wp-image-2598 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Toronto-Permit-by-Building-Type-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

Our analysis shows that a significant volume of non-residential construction investment in Toronto is directed at mixed-use developments. Many of these projects include commercial office, which will help add millions of square feet of supply to the city. As of July 2018, Toronto had <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/toronto-economy-labour-force-demographics/major-non-residential-developments/">7.8 million sf of office space</a> under construction and 15.9 million sf in preconstruction.

In the residential sector, condos continue to be a popular building type, but apartment projects have been steadily increasing over the last few years. This rise in multi-family developments has, in part, been in response to the <a href="http://placestogrow.ca/index.php?Itemid=14&amp;id=430&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view">higher density targets</a> outlined in the 2017 Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan.

Public sector work, particularly in infrastructure, is also contributing to the construction activity across the Area. Nearly $6.7 billion in projects are currently underway, including mass transit, wastewater treatment, and public space improvements.
<h5><strong>Most Active Design Firms</strong></h5>
<img class="size-large wp-image-2595 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Architects-Toronto-Chart-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

Collectively, the top 10 most active design firms in Toronto are involved in over 50% of the total projects we are tracking. These include projects that have been recently completed or are currently in preconstruction or under construction.

Architects across the Greater Toronto Area are generally reporting a high volume of work and healthy pipelines moving forward.
<h5><strong>Most Active Developers</strong></h5>
<img class="size-large wp-image-2596 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Developers-Toronto-Chart-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

Among the most active developers in Toronto, 2 of the top 10 are public agencies, reflecting the level of involvement that the public sector has in changing the city.

Not surprisingly, 9 of the top 10 most active developers are heavily involved in condo projects. Over 90% of the projects we tracked from these 9 developers are condo or condo-based mixed-use developments.
<h4><strong>Trends</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Mass Transit Revitalizing and Regenerating New Development Areas</strong></h5>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2604 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hurontario-LRT.jpg" alt="" width="999" height="560" />
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This new $1.9 billion, 20km, P3 DBFOM light rail will connect Mississauga and Brampton with 22 stops. This line is one of many that are helping trigger the building boom across the GTA. MGAC provided support on project controls.</em></p>
In late 2008, the Government of Ontario implemented <a href="http://www.metrolinx.com/thebigmove/Docs/big_move/TheBigMove_020109.pdf">The Big Move</a>, a 25-year, $50 billion plan to transform transportation across the GTA and Hamilton Region. This comprehensive plan includes the addition of over 43 kilometres of new Light Rail Transit (LRT) tracks that will extend the reach of 3 major LRT lines throughout the region.

This expanding transit network is acting as a catalyst for the redevelopment and regeneration of the region by improving access to previously less accessible areas, as well as encouraging and enabling denser transit-oriented developments.

The Eglinton LRT for instance is helping to revitalize the Eglinton Corridor. The extended line has triggered a development boom in the Yonge Eglinton Centre and the Yonge Eglinton node, reaching as far east as Golden Mile, where large master plan intensification schemes to prime big box retailers and shopping centers for intensification.

Despite the approval of funding for a significant number of infrastructure projects to date, the roll-out of remaining funding is anticipated to slow down over the coming years.
<h5><strong>Demographic Shifts Continue to Drive Development and Density</strong></h5>
The GTA is one of the fastest growing areas in North America. The GTA population was 6.9 million in 2017 and is projected to reach 9.7 million by 2041, which is expected to account for over 50% of Ontario’s total population.

Immigration will play a major role in this growth. As part of Canada’s economic growth strategy, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2017/11/01/canadian-government-to-raise-annual-immigrant-intake-by-13-by-2020.html">the annual immigrant intake will be increased by 13% by 2020</a>, and Toronto remains the top destination for immigrants to Canada due to its stable economy, demand for skilled labour, relatively low crime rates, and incredible diversity.

In addition to immigration changes, demographic shifts have also helped fuel the demand for new, higher density, housing across the GTA. According to Mansoor Kazerouni, <em>“People increasingly want to move from large suburban single-family homes to more urban mixed-use transit connected multi-family residences where they can live, work, learn, play within their communities.”</em>

<em>“This development doesn’t end at dwelling units. To complete these communities, there are a host of other essential services that need to be provided whether it be transit, parks, schools, community centers – all of that is contributing to the significant building activity that we are seeing in our city.”</em>
<h5><strong>Toronto, the Next Silicon Valley?</strong></h5>
Toronto is becoming known as a major technology hub and has been unofficially dubbed the “Silicon Valley of the North”. Benefiting from an educated workforce, a density of world class research institutions, a favorable immigration policy, and a pole on the <a href="https://thecorridor.ca/">Toronto-Waterloo Corridor</a>, Toronto is currently home to between 2,100 and 4,100 active tech start-ups, according to a report by <a href="https://www.techtoronto.org/">Tech Toronto</a>.

Since Google’s move into the Downtown financial core, many other tech companies and major firms from other industries have followed its footsteps and formed a significant force driving the commercial and office developments within the region.

This massive demand for office space has significantly outstripped new supply and created a near gridlock situation in downtown Toronto, with <a href="https://www.westerninvestor.com/news/british-columbia/toronto-office-market-dwarfs-downtown-vancouver-s-1.23448160">office vacancy rates down to a record-low of 3.4%</a>. It remains to be seen if this lack of available office space will stifle Toronto’s transformation into a tech hub.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An <a href="https://www.aia.org/articles/92326-adaptive-reuse-breathing-new-life-into-old-b">AIA article</a> said it best, <em>“Adaptive reuse breathes new life into old bones. It is a method of protecting historically significant buildings from demolition. It promotes sustainability and counteracts urban sprawl. Best of all, it challenges us to find value in the past and make it not just new again, but different and better.”</em>

Historic adaptive reuse is the repositioning or reprogramming of a historic building for a new use, often incorporating the historic aspects of the original shell and interior.

The cost, environmental, and social benefits of historic adaptive reuse are well known among construction industry professionals, but these types of projects do come with a number of potential challenges and risks.

Successful historic adaptive reuse projects effectively plan for, mitigate, and manage such risks through strategic upfront investments, the most important of which is a very careful due diligence process. This article explains where due diligence efforts should be concentrated and highlight the potential cost premiums for specific areas/components in historic adaptive reuse projects.
<h4><strong>Typical Cost Premiums vs New Build </strong></h4>
Historic adaptive reuse project costs vary depending on the project type and degree of building preservation required. Costs can range from significantly more expensive to slightly less expensive compared to a similar new-build project. For building additions, such as a project that adds several modernized floors to an existing historic structure, project costs can be more expensive then a new-build. In an adaptive reuse repositioning project however, overall project costs are typically less than a new-build, especially after taking the land purchase price into account.

Although the unique existing conditions and planned programs of adaptive reuse projects make it difficult to provide cost benchmarks, the table below provides a rough cost differential for a new build and a significant historic adaptive re-use project in the Mid-Atlantic Region.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2638 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Cost-comparison-chart-1024x536.png" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />
<h4><strong>7 Specific High Cost Impact Project Areas</strong></h4>
Some of the areas with the greatest cost premiums can be surprising to Owners, considering the majority of the building’s components are existing. In our experience, however, we find that much of building’s “bones” such as foundations, superstructure, and MEP systems usually require significant work or replacement. Cost premiums are often found in the following areas:
<h5><strong>1.) Labor</strong></h5>
<img class="size-large wp-image-2645 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CUA-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

<em>Finely detailed interiors such as the one pictured above at <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/2015-best-project-renovationrestoration/">Catholic University's Father O'Connell Hall</a>, create stunning spaces but can increase labor costs.</em>

The cost breakdown for a historic adaptive reuse project is typically 60% labor/40% materials, compared to a typical new-build at 55% labor/45% materials.

This reduced productivity is due to challenging working conditions and the number of unknowns, hazmat abatement issues, and inefficient existing MEP pathways that crews must contend with throughout the duration of the project – factors that are covered below in more depth.

<strong>Spotlight: Logistics </strong>– Many historic buildings have smaller elevator shafts and no freight elevators, which can complicate and slow the process of moving construction materials. In order to maintain productivity, construction crews need to find creative solutions around limited access space.

On some MGAC projects, this has meant using existing or enlarged window openings to crane in materials or removing some of the roof slab or existing elevator pop-up to provide access. These costs premiums are typically reflected in the labor cost premiums or the contractor’s general requirements within transportation or rigging costs.
<h5><strong>2.) Custom Materials </strong></h5>
Windows, doors, and elevators are some of the most common components that need to be specially procured and installed due to historic and aesthetic requirements, logistical restrictions, and unique building dimensions.

Custom products may only have 1 or 2 vendors available to provide bids, which can reduce competition and increase the price. Because custom vendors usually work hand-in-hand with the team from preconstruction through design development, arming the Owner with relevant cost data can help to define and confine the budget earlier in the design. Without such data, Owners can get cornered later in the project when low initial contractor bids balloon throughout the design phase.

<img class="size-large wp-image-2653 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FOCH-1024x536.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" />

<em>The irregularly sized window openings of many historic buildings can impact cost by requiring customized products and additional installation time. How many different window sizes can you count in this conference room?</em>

<strong>Spotlight: Windows</strong> – Window openings on older buildings are typically not uniform in size and if the building is historic, the local advisory board may require replacement in kind or with an aesthetic match to the original. The 2 main cost drivers are the fact that window openings:
<ul>
 	<li>Typically don’t match up to modern standard dimensions and/or are not uniform in size across the building. A significant amount of preparation and alteration may be required before installation.</li>
 	<li>Are constructed from steel or aluminum. If the Owner is looking for the same durability, look, and feel, they may want steel replacement windows, which are usually significantly more expensive than aluminum replicas.</li>
</ul>
A benchmark range for aluminum windows is $100-140 / SF of window area and for steel windows $140-175 / SF of window area. Cost will vary depending on quantity, quality, number of panes and installation logistics.
<h5><strong>3.) Structural Changes</strong></h5>
Additions, expansions, roof gardens, reconfigurations are common in historic projects. These modifications have major structural implications that often require selective demolition, additional foundations, structural strengthening, underpinning, bracing, and possible code upgrades for seismic requirements.

About 75% of the adaptive or historic projects I have worked on have required structural upgrades, which range from just reinforcing some connections to underpinning the existing foundations and lowering the basement. Costs obviously will vary significantly.
<h5><strong>4.) Hazmat Abatement</strong></h5>
A reasonable benchmark range for a ‘typical’ historic building with lead paint, hazardous flooring materials, waterproofing or flooring mastics, piping insulation, and minor other miscellaneous items is between $2.5-6.5 / SF applied to the building floor area.

Depending on the extent of hazardous abatement required, however, the costs for removal can vary significantly. For example, on one higher-education project with minimal abatement including mastic on vinyl tile, some lead paint, and a small amount of piping removal, the cost was $1.75 / SF based on the building’s gross square footage.

At the other end of the spectrum, on a former university lab used for testing chemical weapons during World War II, the abatement cost was around $50 / SF before demolition even started.
<h5><strong>5.) Basement and Foundation</strong> <strong>Waterproofing</strong></h5>
Some Owners are reluctant to waterproof below grade because it is expensive and does not visibly help fulfill the vision or the program. However, waterproofing is often a necessary investment to protect the building. The cost can be extremely high if the whole basement needs waterproofing from the outside and even higher if the foundation requires treatment.

What we have typically seen (unless there is significant water penetration) is limited waterproofing on one side of the building and then interior water protection which may include sealant, interior drainage, or addition of sump pumps. Benchmarking, again, is difficult to set, but for waterproofing the basement wall excluding excavation the cost is around $10-15 / SF of wall area, depending on the application chosen.
<h5><strong>6.) MEP Systems</strong></h5>
<img class="size-large wp-image-2662 aligncenter" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MEP-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" />

<em>Thick stone walls on some historic buildings can create challenges when routing new MEP systems.</em>

Original MEP systems are typically outdated and in most cases, the equipment is replaced or the system is removed completely.

Issues are typically encountered when routing MEP piping because the existing pathway is not always the most efficient route. Many historic buildings have structural floor slabs made of material such as terracotta that may require costly reinforcements to cut openings for installation. The issues that commonly occur are difficult piping routes due to thick walls (includes conduits, ductwork, piping and risers), disturbance of HazMat materials, limited existing mechanical space volumes, insufficient power for the new program, and local reinforcement for the new equipment.

In some cases, however, these issues can be largely circumvented with non-traditional installation methods. On a current project, a 100 year old building with thick stone walls, our team needed to find pathways for ductwork. Rather than running conduits through the existing and fire proofing the openings, the engineer chose to go around the walls, which was quicker but required more material.
<h5><strong>7.) Acoustics</strong></h5>
Depending on the new planned use of the building, acoustics can be a cost driver that is often not identified until late in the Design phase.

On one recent MGAC project, historic building repositioned as a museum, the building required a set of interior windows inset from the existing historic windows to achieve the program’s acoustical and climate control requirements. Additionally, because the exterior façade and slabs were not thick enough to properly insulate sound, acoustical plaster and insulation needed to be applied. Obviously if these issues would not have been present in a new, purpose-built building.
<h4><strong>Recommendations</strong></h4>
The one-of-a-kind experiences created by historic adaptive reuse projects require an equally unique approach to building successfully and within budget. In any project incorporating existing components, due diligence is critical to managing risk and controlling costs. As imaging/scanning technologies such as LIDAR and other tools become available, project teams will be able to have increasingly reliable data, but some difficult-to-reach building components such as structural beams or foundations will remain a challenge. Having an experienced team in place and making the right upfront investments can pay dividends by helping mitigate potential issues later in the project.

In addition to taking steps early to manage risk, it is also important to plan for the unexpected issues and complications that will inevitably arise. When developing your project budget and schedule, I recommend setting aside an increased amount for:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Change Orders</strong> – Change orders on historic adaptive reuse projects average 10-15% of construction cost, compared to 5-8% on new build projects. Spending time and money upfront on probes, surveys, and investigations can pay significant dividends as the project begins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Contingencies </strong>– On new projects, project contingency is recommended at approximately 3-6% based on project size and complexity, but on historic projects, a 7-10% is more prudent. The specific amount will depend on the risk assessment and the quality of existing documentation available such as original blue prints and previous building surveys.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="BodyA">As MGAC marked its first anniversary of collaboration with <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile</a>, plans for the Un-carrier’s $160M Bellevue campus renovation were made public. T-Mobile will create a sustainably focused, team-first, agile environment in their longtime Pacific Northwest headquarters for over 6,000 employees. The new, creative space will celebrate T-Mobile's diverse workforce and bring the brand to life for employees and visitors.</p>
<p class="BodyA">MGAC is providing T-Mobile project management and owners representation services — among a multitude of other critical tasks — to bring this unique and highly visible project to fruition. Other collaboration points include cost and risk management, procurement, change management communication and messaging, and technology planning.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2675" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/T-Mobile-HQ-4NP-Outdoor-Space_Gensler.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" />
<p class="BodyA">MGAC will continue to work directly alongside T-Mobile during their construction, serving as a true extension of the team. MGAC manages all project partners, budgets, timelines, and the campus’s many critical intricacies. MGAC will ultimately ensure that T-Mobile’s team enjoys and utilizes their new space as intended by T-Mobile leadership. The campus’s central focus - is slated for completion in 2021, but other landmark moments include the completion of the “3305” satellite office, construction of an innovative and dynamic customer experience center, the introduction of a 40,000-square-foot campus amenity centerpiece with food and dining options, gaming, and collaborative meeting space, and the early implementation of technology solutions to make the campus more user-friendly.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2682" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/T-Mobile-HQ-Co-Work-Cubbies_Gensler.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" />
<p class="BodyA">Energy usage and sustainability is at the forefront of T-Mobile’s renovation. When complete, T-Mobile will be the first corporate campus in the U.S. to achieve the “Fitwel Certification”, a commitment to making physical activity the central focus of a workplace with healthier food options, natural lighting, and outdoor spaces. As a member of Puget Sound Energy’s Green Direct program, T-Mobile is committed to powering its Bellevue HQ using 100% renewable energy by 2021, plus it will also earn a LEED certification with its sustainable green building design, construction and ongoing maintenance and operations. These needs are consistent with many MGAC renovations or construction projects - most recently bringing a three-year Net Zero renovation to fruition for the American Geophysical Union headquarters, the first of its kind in the nation’s capital.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2677" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/T-Mobile-HQ-Updated-Bar_Gensler.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" />
<p class="BodyA">Over the past year, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O’Connor</a>, MGAC Managing Director, has provided project oversight and built MGAC’s on-site project team. She states, “We regularly encourage our clients to push the envelope and deliver what’s not yet been done, or is expected — and T-Mobile is no different. Though MGAC has previously worked on major office relocations and renovations with <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/hilton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilton Worldwide</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-greetings-headquarters/190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Greetings</a>, our management of T-Mobile’s forward-thinking campus renovation is an unprecedented project. We are thrilled to work alongside the T-Mobile team at each step of the way.”</p>
<p class="BodyA">MGAC has long had a presence in Seattle, but the T-Mobile collaboration solidified their need to expand and grow their team to support a growing clientele, which also includes 5th and Stewart Hotel &amp; Residences, the Macy’s Downtown Seattle Building, citizenM Hotel, and Capital One. MGAC‘s Seattle office employs 15 people with plans to make five additional hires by spring 2019.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday, we witnessed Mayor Muriel Bowser sign the ambitious <a href="http://www.carbonpricedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CleanEnergyDC.OnePage.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act of 2018</a>. Among other things, the bill will now require all DC electricity to come from renewable sources and calls for vast improvements to the energy efficiency of existing buildings within the District. As a new leading example for green commercial buildings in DC, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-geophysical-union-headquarters/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Geophysical Union (AGU) Headquarters</a>, where the bill was signed, provided a fitting backdrop for this historic moment.

Since 2013, the AGU Headquarters has undergone serious renovations in order to become the first Net Zero energy renovation of a commercial office building in the city and we are proud to have provided project management, cost and risk management, technology solutions, and procurement services for the project. The end result will modernize the 20-year-old workplace into a bright, more employee-friendly space that now embodies AGU’s mission to strive for and set an example for a more sustainable future.

With the passage of this legislation, we hope to see more ambitious projects like that of the AGU Headquarters break ground in DC and beyond.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sheldon Shapiro, CEO of Shapiro &amp; Duncan passed away Thursday at his home in Bethesda, MD. MGAC offers its deepest condolences to the Shapiro family and all of Shapiro &amp; Duncan. The growth of the firm over the years is an amazing story to be told. Sheldon, his brother Jerry, and brother in law Charlie Ayres have turned a small HVAC and plumbing business into one of Washington’s most active power house mechanical contractors, all by Sheldon’s tender age of 53. The Sheldon that I knew was all business. The story of Duncan’s early role in securing bank credit to grow the business, which I will not repeat to keep Sheldon’s confidences, is a classic that should be studied in business school.

Sheldon, Jerry, and Charlie built the business on a dedication to doing things smarter, working harder, working ethically, and breaking new ground. Shapiro &amp; Duncan’s outreach to local high schools to encourage young people into the building trades is second to none. The creation of computer aided manufacturing processes to major mechanical and plumbing work; taking CAD/BIM coordination documents and converting coordination into literal cut/weld/fabrication in a highly controlled factory setting is a sight to behold. Major components can be factory tested, certified, and lifted into place speeding construction and quality. Ancillary benefits of this process are greater jobsite safety and coordination of trades.

Above all, Sheldon was a kind person. Thankfully I never had to ask many favors of Sheldon, but he was always there to express his concern, offer his advice (usually in the form of a question that made you squirm, which meant he already had the answer, and was just making sure you got to the same place he already was). Sheldon was calm, and a steady presence in any meeting and at the helm of his company. He will be missed by anyone who knew him and by our industry. He touched many lives and families by providing training and development opportunities for young people entering our industry. Thank you Sheldon. I will remember you with a sense of gratitude for what you accomplished.]]></content:encoded>

On February 22nd, the Memorial University of Newfoundland’s <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/memorial-university-of-newfoundland/45" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Core Science Facility</a> construction site was visited by Prime Minister Trudeau, The Honourable Seamus O'Regan (Minster of Indigenous Services) and Member of Parliament for St. John’s East, Mr. Nick Whalen. Memorial University and the project team were very much delighted and quite excited to host this visit.

The Core Science Facility continues to be an important project for Memorial University of Newfoundland, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and in many respects, a portion of significant initiative to improve Canada.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Default">According to the latest data from the <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span>, women make up just 9.9% of the construction industry workforce. Here at MGAC we’re proud to have above average representation of women (33% overall) with women represented across every team within our company. We count women in our ranks across state lines and even country lines. We’ve got projects on the books that broke ground and were brought to completion by teams primarily staffed by women and have women-led teams on site right at this very moment.</p>
<p class="Default">At MGAC, we’re lucky to be surrounded by women who make us proud to be in this industry, who push us to do better and to be better each and every day. On this Women In Construction Week, we’d like to say thank you to the women that choose to be a part of our family here at MGAC and would like to highlight some who are paving the way for others in the industry.</p>
<p class="Default"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-fleming-30963479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia Fleming</a>, one of our Project Managers based in Toronto has been in the industry for nearly a decade. Originally drawn to the field for its exciting, fast-pace, today she’s oftentimes in charge of setting that pace and is looked up to by many women early in their careers here at MGAC. Alicia, now credits her career trajectory to a female mentor she connected with when she was just starting out in the industry.</p>
<p class="Default">“I was blessed with an incredible mentor very early on in my career; this woman encouraged me to spread my wings, to be open to broader horizons and taught me that this industry can offer you the opportunity to see the world. I have carried this advice with me all of these years and it’s given me the opportunity to work in many different countries. She also taught me that there is always a seat at the table for women in this industry.”</p>
<p class="Default"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mimi-toner-2b38b718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimi Toner</a>, a Vice President at MGAC based in our DC office is a registered architect and project manager with over twenty years of experience in the industry. Throughout the years, she’s gained hands-on knowledge of every phase of a construction project ranging from initial design work to project delivery. She offers an invaluable perspective to our team and is a testament to the vast number of career trajectories the construction industry can offer to women. To those women hoping to one day explore a new career path in the industry or advance to leadership as she has, she offers this sage advice:</p>
<p class="Default">“I believe that women in construction need to find their voices on project teams; and if you don’t understand something or see something that does not makes sense, you should ask questions. Speaking up and asking questions often helps teams flag issues and solve problems earlier.”</p>
<p class="Default">We often tell people that MGAC is a place where you can count on coming to work each day alongside smart, passionate people who truly enjoy putting in the work to build something that endures. That kind of work and tangible energy wouldn’t be possible without women like Mimi and Alicia—women who are committed to shaping the future of MGAC and of what’s possible in our industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Sourced from <em>Urban Institute</em></h6>
<h6>03/11/2019</h6>
Created in 1968 to bring unbiased evidence to bear in solving America’s social and economic ills, the Urban Institute has always known a single home in Washington, DC.

That changes March 11, when the Institute’s staff of more than 525 researchers, analysts, and experts take up residence at brand-new headquarters: <strong>500 L’Enfant Plaza in the District’s Southwest quadrant</strong>.

Urban will occupy eight floors of a new, LEED-certified, <a href="https://www.jbgsmith.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBG Smith</a> building. It features a state-of-the art conference center, a rooftop terrace, and proximity to Metro, the surrounding federal office complex, and the Wharf.

“Urban has accomplished so much in its first fifty years at 2100 M Street. Over decades, we have greatly grown our staff, expertise, and capacity for both developing world-class research and sharing it with the world,” said Urban Institute president Sarah Rosen Wartell. “As we begin <a href="https://next50.urban.org/">our next fifty years</a>, we move to a new headquarters that empowers us to build on that legacy and embrace the future, with powerful new technology, welcoming spaces in which to collaborate and host public events, and a location in a rapidly evolving neighborhood.”

Wartell continued, “Urban has always been proud to call DC home. I am excited about the new role we will play in Southwest DC. Surrounded by federal offices, high-end redevelopment, and families that have long lived in affordable housing, Urban can work with these seemingly disparate communities toward a vision of inclusive growth and shared prosperity, drawing from our work to make greater DC an area of opportunity.”

Through its <a href="https://greaterdc.urban.org/">Greater DC initiative</a>, Urban is bringing data and analysis to strengthen the performance of DC public schools, help the region absorb the impact of Amazon HQ2 on housing, ensure community residents benefit from development of the 11th Street Bridge Park, and close wealth gaps among communities. Urban even sheds light on what bike shares can tell us about the inequity among DC neighborhoods.

Inspired by its milestone anniversary, Urban has launched a <a href="https://next50.urban.org/">Next50</a> initiative, exploring what it would take to advance equity and upward mobility in the decades ahead.

<a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/blue-whale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out of the Depths: The Blue Whale Story</a> tells the story of two whales washed ashore in Western Newfoundland in April of 2014.

A partnership with MUN and the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Ontario Museum</a>(ROM) has preserved the two giant mammals, which the museum then arranged to have cleaned and the skeletons prepared for display.

Found together, the whales will now have separate homes – one committed to the exhibit in Toronto, ON and the other to the atrium of MUN’s new <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/memorial-university-of-newfoundland/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Science Facility</a>, for which MGAC is serving as project manager.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="BodyA"><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/new-hq-remodel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile</a>’s Seattle / Bellevue campus has been overtaken by magenta hard hats and magenta vests worn by the on-the-ground teams of MGAC and <a href="https://www.andersen-const.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andersen Construction</a>. In recent months, MGAC and Andersen Construction have worked closely together to help breathe new life into the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile headquarters</a>. As project managers for the renovation, we are tasked with shepherding the three-year renovation to the finish line, delivering T-Mobile the headquarters of its dreams — one that better reflects the brand’s energy and innovative spirit.</p>
<p class="BodyA">One of the most inspiring parts of our job is collaborating with folks who are experts in their respective fields. While we oversee timelines, review budgets, assist with move management, and many other details in between, we marvel at seeing the client’s vision being executed by its other project partners. At T-Mobile, the Andersen <span lang="FR">Construction </span>team is responsible for the physical renovation itself, pouring their time and effort into quite literally getting the project off the ground. They share our values and goals, and have become immersed in T-Mobile’s world, just as we have. We thought we’d sit down for a chat with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyson-byers-6556207/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson Byers</a>, a project manager at Andersen, about his role on the project and favorite elements of the renovation.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2782" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-12.40.32-1.jpg" alt="" width="963" height="717" />
<p class="BodyA"><b><span lang="IT">One Big, Magenta Team: </span></b></p>
<p class="BodyA">The T-Mobile campus spans nearly 1 million SF, with multiple buildings serving unique purposes, and thousands of employees. Undertaking a renovation project of this scale requires every team member on the ground to work in lockstep along every step of the way. From our perspective, this collaborative process with Andersen has been an easy one, and according to Byers, that feeling is mutual.</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="padding-left: 40px;"><i>“Working with MGAC on the T-Mobile project has been a unique experience due to the amount of collaboration on everything from solidifying the vision, to budget discussions, to managing our ongoing schedules. We share the same vision and are all working towards the same common goal.” </i>-Tyson Byers</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>On Bringing The Vision To Life: </b></p>
<p class="BodyA">Though our tasks and executions vary, each project team involved in T-Mobile’s renovation is working towards making the company’s vision and brilliant ideas a reality.</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="padding-left: 40px;"><i>“T-Mobile wanted to take on this renovation project because they felt that their headquarters did not reflect their current vision as a company. They knew that they must focus on their Seattle campus, a place that is readily seen by clients and which, of course, houses many of their employees. It’s our job here at Andersen, and is at MGAC as well, to really understand and embody that vision. We listen closely to what T-Mobile has to say both in meetings and on the ground every day to effectively drive this project forward. We understand T-Mobile’s mindset and organizational goals. We realize that to them, this project is bigger than just a new space. When this project is complete, it’s going to change the mindset of T-Mobile’s employees and customers, and ultimately change how the world sees the brand.”
</i><i>-Tyson Byers</i></p>

<p class="BodyA"><b>On Favorite Project Details: </b></p>
<p class="BodyA">As project managers, we become completely invested in delivering project outcomes, meaning we are attentive to every single project detail. Many of those details are fun and fascinating — and we always have our favorites. As it turns out, so does the Andersen crew.</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="padding-left: 40px;"><i>“I’m most excited about T-Mobile’s new front door because I think it really speaks to the T-Mobile vision. It will be a very neat and fun design that’s really unique to this campus. I don’t think that there’s another campus in Seattle that has a porte-coch</i><i><span lang="FR">è</span>re with sheer aluminum tubes! When you pull onto this campus, you’re going to know it’s the T-Mobile campus. You’ll know right away what they’re all about. Beyond that, once you get past that front door, you’ll discover amazing new amenity spaces for employees that showcase their commitment to the employee experience.” </i><i>-Tyson Byers </i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Default">As project managers, the mantra is always to deliver on time and on budget. It sounds simple, but there are a lot of potential obstacles. At <span lang="DE">MGAC</span>, we know schedule management is essential to our ability to make missions possible. Anything can happen on a construction project, these five techniques will help keep your project on track.</p>
<p class="Default"><b>Things Happen</b></p>
<p class="Default">While much of the schedule is forecasted before the shovels ever hit the ground, schedule management requires a dynamic approach and constant benchmarking and revisions. All projects will have minor hiccups along the way and accounting for those hiccups in the schedule to ensure that these small problems do not become larger ones. ‘Tomorrow’ is often the busiest day of the week and the domino effect of any delay is a very real risk that must be accounted for in this line of work.</p>
<p class="Default"><b>Schedules Don’t Exist in a Vacuum</b></p>
<p class="Default">The best schedule managers come to the job with a background in project management (PM) work. Schedule managers must “speak the language” of PMs, be familiar with common project delays, and know how to best rectify those delays. That kind of big-picture understanding and the know-how required to spot a potential mountain in a sea of molehills only comes with on-the-ground experience.</p>
<p class="Default"><b>Know your Tools</b></p>
<p class="Default">Pen and paper scheduling is definitely a thing of the past. Today, schedule managers are fortunate to have strong software solutions that allow for real-time updates, team collaboration and accessibility everywhere — even on the job site. The right tool can help with everything from document management to tracking the lifecycle of the project. Choose wisely!</p>
<p class="Default"><b>Sharing is Caring</b></p>
<p class="Default">Schedule management requires staying in constant communication everyone involved in a construction project - the construction firm, the architects, the client and important stakeholders. Schedule management requires keeping these groups in the loop and, more importantly, held accountable.</p>
<p class="Default"><b>No Detail is Too Small </b></p>
<p class="Default">With large budgets, multiple parties, and at times, the threat of legal action it’s vital that schedule managers never miss a beat when it comes to staying on top of the schedule. It is a serious job that requires full focus and attention to detail to ensure nothing slips through the cracks.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Washington Post has named MGAC one of their <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/#large" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Top Workplaces</a> in the Greater Washington area. The recognition affirms MGAC’s commitment to fostering a unique and collaborative environment where our staff can grow personally and professionally. For us, it has always been about the people. Our open positions are more than just career opportunities – we hire unusually talented individuals who will inspire and be inspired by our diverse, accomplished team, and contribute to our award-winning culture.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2856" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Quotes-1-e1561136111927.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="441" />

Over the past decade, MGAC has been recognized as a top workplace by the Washington Post, Washingtonian, and Washington Business Journal. The Washington Post selects winners in three categories — small, midsize, and large; awards are based solely on voluntary and confidential employee feedback in relation to job satisfaction within the workplace.

[gallery size="large" ids="2873,2865,2868,2870,2869,2871"]

To celebrate the acknowledgement, MGAC employees gathered for cocktails and hors d’oeuvres at DBGB. The following week, some of our staff members attended The Washington Post awards ceremony, toasting to our achievement alongside other Top Workplace winners.

<p class="Default">The addition of the Pennsylvania Avenue building will allow the university to consolidate its growing downtown footprint into a central, state-of-the-art location for students, faculty, and the DC community at large. The new location will provide research and networking opportunities in the DC metro area for students based in the University’s flagship Baltimore campus. Originally opened in 2008, the building boasts over 400,000 square feet and unrivaled views of the Capitol. The renovation work for the facility—which will include the creation of new classrooms, research facilities, offices and spaces earmarked for community gatherings—could begin in Fall of 2020.</p>
<p class="Default">Our team is thrilled to help shepherd the process of creating this world-class academic center, serving as program manager to provide project management, cost and risk estimating, and schedule management for the duration of the renovation<span lang="DE">. We</span>’re honored to continue our legacy of work within the academic sector in such an iconic space that is sure to impact those who enter its doors for years to come.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The launch of any project is always exciting. Helping a client’s vision and passion come to life is, after all, what MGAC is all about. In the case of the grand opening of <a href="https://www.twobirdsdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Birds</a>, licensed childcare that also offers co-working space, it’s especially gratifying as the company sets out to create a community that supports and nurtures strong families, education, and relationships.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2913" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_0711.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" />

Two Birds is the brainchild of co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelseylents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelsey Lents</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jp-coakley-73b7bb90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JP Coakley</a> who developed the concept while attending Georgetown Business School<em> and</em> becoming new parents. The timing of Two Birds coincided with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser’s initiatives to make childcare costs more affordable and plentiful. Lents and Coakley secured a $330,000 grant from the city to build Two Birds, which also accepts childcare subsidiary vouchers from low-income families.

Two Birds seamlessly blends co-working and childcare spaces, while also operating independently. The childcare space accommodates 72 infants and toddlers and 42 pre-K children. Members can pay for co-working services or licensed childcare, or both.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2916" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Two-Birds-8.jpg" alt="" width="5613" height="3744" />

Conveniently located near the Tenleytown-AU Metro station in Northwest DC, Two Birds shares the same building as Bloom Ob-Gyn and Sport &amp; Health Gym, where Two Birds members receive a 20% discount – and, the free-for-all DC residents Wilson Aquatic Center, Whole Foods, Fort Reno Park, and public library are all within easy walking distance.

On the childcare front, members, babies, and children enjoy flexible options for full-time care, part-time, mornings only, or afternoons only. Infant, toddler, and pre-K classrooms, licensed caregivers, a Reggio Emilia-inspired curriculum (experiential, child and relationship-centered), community play space, and summer camp options provide flexibility, security, and peace of mind. Perhaps best of all, parents and caregivers can visit their children anytime.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2918" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Two-Birds-4.jpg" alt="" width="5613" height="3744" />

On the co-working side, Two Birds members can expect flexible, full-equipped spaces with perks like shared or dedicated desks, an open pantry and coffee bar, conference room, private telephone rooms, private pump room and nursing lounge (alongside other nursing moms), as well as parenting and baby enrichment classes.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2919" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Two-Birds-11.jpg" alt="" width="5612" height="3744" />

Two Birds’ nursing lounge is especially unique space – with comfortable seating, laptop tables, and dimmable lights for those that want to relax. Additional space to pump and/or nurse is available right outside the classroom area. The space is equipped with the latest technology. Members can even sign in and out of the space via their mobile device or tablet.

On the project management side, securing building permits for Two Birds was a challenge, as the DC market is inundated with permit requests and delays often ensure. The construction team was under the gun to get the doors open as customers were already lined up – ready to have their childcare and workspace needs met! Thanks to a heroic team effort, the space opened on-time.

As Two Birds looks to open a second location to serve more families, Kelsey, JP, and the design team are taking the lessons learned in the complex world of childcare regulations and licensing and putting them to use to ensure an even more efficient and successful launch of all the locations to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today’s most coveted energy certification is <span class="s1"><a href="https://building.agu.org/about-the-project/net-zero-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Zero</a> —meaning a building has achieved an annual balance between energy demand and energy creation</span>. Net Zero is achieved by reducing, reclaiming, absorbing, and generating energy through a variety of advanced architectural, design, engineering, and technological methods.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike prior sustainability certifications, Net Zero certification is not done through energy modeling. The final certification process requires a full year of operation and is based on the actual performance of the building. Implementing the appropriate monitoring and metering systems to provide this performance data must be integrated into the project scope and verified as part of the project commissioning process.</p>
<p class="p1">MGAC had the privilege of working on a three-year project for the Net Zero and LEED Platinum renovation of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-geophysical-union-headquarters/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Geophysical Union</a>’s Washington, DC headquarters. The building is slated to be the first and only Net Zero renovation project in the nation’s capital with 100% onsite generation of renewable power.</p>
<p class="p1">The project is being completed on the heels of new and highly progressive legislation in DC regarding energy efficiency and sustainability requirements for future design and construction projects. Signed into effect on January 18th, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/dc-mayor-signs-historic-clean-energy-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act</a> calls for cutting DC’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2032, putting the onus on property owners to carefully consider their energy consumption.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At MGAC, we use the basic tenants of project management and problem solving to bring our clients’ most challenging – and creative – “what ifs” to life.

From complex art installations to meticulous museum exhibit construction, we’ve served as trusted advisor and project manager for an array of artists and private and publicly funded cultural projects.

Together with our network of professionals – from structural engineers to subject matter experts in everything from aviation to zoology – we conduct feasibility studies, tackle logistical complexities, negotiate contracts, and manage stakeholders – across town or around the world.

[caption id="attachment_2964" align="aligncenter" width="822"]<img class="wp-image-2964 " src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/KBuster.jpg" alt="" width="822" height="635" /> Kendall Buster Installation[/caption]

While many clients love the idea of an art installation, they don’t know how to align their vision with the right artist or manage the production process. Art galleries, which may be adept at fielding inquiries for art installations, often don’t have the skills and experience to negotiate contracts that protect the interests of both artist and client. On the artist side, many lack access to the lines of credit other vendors take for granted. Ensuring the artist is financially secure throughout the project and the client is seeing regular progress is critical to its ultimate success. Navigating the complexities of these relationships and processes is what we love to do – and where we deliver for clients, again and again.

We’re proud to have worked with artist <a href="https://www.kendallbuster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Buster</a> on more than 25 commissions from project inception to final delivery and installation. Together we’ve built a partnership based on mutual trust.

<a href="https://www.kendallbuster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2974" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Quote-e1566313705518.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="354" /></a>
<h5>OUTFLOW: SCULPTURE MEETS ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS</h5>
Outflow, designed as an inverted replica of Calgary’s Mount Peechee, promotes awareness of how public actions impact the environment by collecting trash, pollutants, and contaminants to show exactly what flows through storm sewers into the Bow River.

We worked on behalf of artist <a href="http://www.briantollestudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Tolle</a> on this complex, six-year project navigating the challenges associated with altering existing pipelines to connect this large sculpture directly into Calgary’s public drainage system. We coordinated the construction and precise installation with city engineers, installers, art fabricators, and the manufacturer of the sculpture’s strong, fiber-reinforced, semi-flexible concrete material, Ductal.

[caption id="attachment_2967" align="aligncenter" width="809"]<img class="wp-image-2967 " src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tolle_FOHHall_5.jpg" alt="" width="809" height="519" /> Outflow By Brian Tolle[/caption]

Outflow’s elegant form, constructed on top of a gravel filled foundation system that can be drained in times of flood, also functions to protect the river by allowing “daylighting” to occur – a process where certain volatile chemicals evaporate in daylight before reaching the river.

Outflow made its public debut to much fanfare from residents and the local environmental design community. One of eight permanent projects outlined in the UEP’s Public Art Plan, Outflow is everything the City and our client envisioned – a beautiful piece of art that uses creative expression to enhance the community and increase awareness around critical environmental issues impacting Calgary.

It’s been a busy summer on the ground at <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile’s Bellevue Headquarters</a> as work on the new campus continues. As <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/project-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project managers</a> for the expansion and renovation project, we love to celebrate milestones and there have been quite a few in recent weeks! We thought we’d share some on-the-ground dispatch of how things are looking today!
<h4>Building One’s New Front Door Is Coming Along!</h4>
Building one, is slated to get a brand new entrance which will serve as the new “front door” to the campus. It’s important to T-Mobile, which prides itself on being the “uncarrier,” to set the tone for employees coming to work that this isn’t your typical office space and this vibrant front door is going to do just that! With steel going up, it won’t be long until this all comes to life!
<h4>The Inside of Building One Has a Whole New Look</h4>
Of course, what will have the most impact on employees is the experience they’ll have when they enter work each day and this building is now designed to ensure more flexibility and collaboration workspaces, and more ways to have fun. For a look at what this building will now offer employees, check out the latest video from T-Mobile’s VP of Corporate Real Estate &amp; Facilities <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darcey-estes-017b324/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darcey Estes</a>.

[video width="1920" height="1080" mp4="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/T-Mobile-Building-1-Tour.mp4"][/video]
<h4>New Food Kiosks and a Grand Staircase Are Under Construction In Building 4NP!</h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3022" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/T-Mobile_Food-Kiosks.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="1950" />

It’s no secret that every employee enjoys lunchtime as a way to clear their mind, recharge, and connect with coworkers. As a part of the renovation, new food kiosks which will be a main feature of an ever-changing food hall, are being installed in building 4NP.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3025" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/T-Mobile_Grand-Staircase.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="1950" />

A grand staircase is always a show-stopping architectural feature and, now that the floor in building two has been opened up, we’re one step closer to seeing that happen!

The grand staircase serves as a platform for lectures, performances, all-hands and meetings. The innovative new redesign of the amenity spaces will focus on creating more collaboration and will have a variety of co-working areas, coffee shops, an ever-changing food hall, and many other third-space areas with comfy chairs that will serve as great spots to foster conversations and problem-solving.

There’s so much happening on the ground each and every day on this campus and we can’t wait to share more updates as we reach more milestones alongside T- Mobile, <a href="https://www.andersen-const.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson Construction</a>, and <a href="https://www.gensler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gensler Architects</a> in this exciting renovation!

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi. Welcome to Building One, at T-Mobile's Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington. I'm Darcey Estes, Vice President of Corporate Real Estate and Facilities. This building got a top to bottom renovation. I mean, it hasn't been touched in over 25 years. We are so proud to finally reveal our work. We have been working hard to create a space that is beautiful, innovative, collaborative, and really represents our brand and is going to support how our employees work.</em>

<em>Let's talk about co-working spaces. On our first floor, working side by side with your coworkers is top of mind. It's set up to provide our employees flexibility and choice, and where and how they do their day-to-day work. There are high top tables, picnic tables, even lounge seating. All you have to do is walk in, hang up your coat, and get to work.</em>

<em>There is so much going on with this campus renovation, and this is just the beginning. I hope you are as excited as we are, and I can't wait to show you what's next.</em>]]></content:encoded>

MGAC is excited to announce the groundbreaking of the <a href="https://campaign.usni.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack C. Taylor Conference Center</a>, a 400-seat auditorium with break-out rooms and a rooftop terrace located adjacent to the Naval Institute’s headquarters on the Naval Academy Yard.

One of the strengths of the <a href="https://www.usni.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Naval Institute</a> is its ability to bring together military and civilian leaders, historians, policymakers, informed citizens, and those who stand watch to illuminate important issues, regardless of official sanction. This new center will do just that – create deeper connections and continue the success of mission-driven educational programs. Named after Jack Taylor, World War II fighter pilot and later founder of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the new Conference Center will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including integrated television production capabilities for live streaming, broadcast, and webcast. It will be able to accommodate meetings up to top secret/SCI and will be LEED Silver certified.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“This groundbreaking is more than just the shoveling of dirt, it’s groundbreaking for our Navy's future - specifically in education, leadership and character training."
</em><em>- Vice Admiral Sean S. Buck, Superintendent, US Naval Academy</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1980, the United Nations established September 27th as World Tourism Day. The purpose is to foster awareness of the impact tourism has globally. In recent years, the event has also called for increased attention to sustainability within the tourism sector. The date of September 27th is significant because it is the anniversary of the adoption of the original UNWTO Statutes. It also interestingly falls at the end of the tourism high season in the northern hemisphere and the beginning of tourism season in the southern hemisphere.

Hospitality is one of MGAC’s core markets. Our hospitality work has surpassed the $1B mark over time. Our team has led the renovation or ground up build of over 100 hotel projects in the past five years alone. Some of the globe’s most reputable hotel developers have enlisted our support in bringing their vision to life. We relish the opportunity to produce projects that endure and stand the test of time.

Today, in honor of World Tourism Day, we’d like to spotlight a few of our hospitality projects.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3060" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lobby_Hilton-Website_High-Res.jpg" alt="" width="1900" height="1048" />
<h3>Hilton Washington DC National Mall</h3>
Close to our DC headquarters, we have been hard at work managing the renovation of the Hilton Washington DC National Mall hotel in L’Enfant Plaza. The iconic 367- room hotel first opened in 1973 and was originally named the L’Enfant Hotel. Like the plaza itself, the hotel is named after Pierre Charles L’Enfant, Washington’s first city planner known for developing the federal territory that would become the District of Columbia. Still today, plaza visitors can see the inscribed title of the original L’Enfant Plan with L’Enfant’s name. Beyond its unique tie to our nation’s history, the hotel is just steps away from many of the District’s museums and popular destinations. The hotel reopened to guests in April 2019 with new modern finishes, advanced technological updates to the guestrooms, and state of the art public and meeting spaces. As a newly branded Hilton, MGAC was also involved in the franchise agreement negotiations and administered the approval process.

<h3>5th &amp; Stewart Hotel &amp; Residences</h3>
On the west coast, we provide project management for the 5th &amp; Stewart Hotel &amp; Residences. The mixed-use, 52-story Seattle property will include 257 guestrooms, 201 residential units, and 1,900 SF of retail. The hotel space will include restaurants and a rooftop bar overlooking Puget Sound. MGAC’s project team is currently managing the entitlement process, coordinating with the city and surrounding neighbors to garner community support while hiring, and managing a diverse team of project consultants.

<h3>Ritz Carlton Zadún</h3>
South of the border, we are serving as the acceptance project manager for the Zadún, a Ritz Carlton Reserve property in San Jose Del Cabo which is slated to open in late 2019. Once open, this will be Ritz Carlton’s fourth Ritz Carlton Reserve property which features secluded and largely untouched destinations. The oceanfront property, which offers sweeping views of the Sea of Cortez, will open with 115 suites and villas along the natural slopes of the land. Each guest space will be outfitted with high luxury features and amenities to place guests in an awe-inspiring natural setting while still offering unrivaled luxury and hospitality at every turn.

Eisenhower Memorial</a> in Washington, DC.

Located on a 4-acre site just south of the National Mall on Independence Avenue, MGAC is managing the art design, fabrication, and installation for the $9M stainless steel woven and welded tapestry. With tapestry installation occurring in Washington, DC, structural engineering in Los Angeles and Seattle, and fabrication in Los Angeles, Memphis and Germany, the students learned about the extensive management and coordination required by the MGAC project team.

Expected to deliver in Q2 2020, the green space features six columns, each standing 80 feet tall and 9 feet wide. The focal point? The tapestry, designed by <a href="http://www.tomasosinski.com/eisenhower-memorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomas Osinski</a>, is made of 604 woven panels that total 600 miles of stainless steel. The image on the tapestry depicts beaches of D-Day with the iconic Pointe du Hoc landmark featured at the center of the hand drawn image.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know over 63,000 people in Montgomery County, Maryland experience hunger and food insecurity? <a href="https://www.mannafood.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manna Food Center</a> was founded in 1983 with the mission of eliminating hunger in the County through food distribution, education, and advocacy. Last month, they celebrated #WorldFoodDay with the grand opening of a new pantry and distribution warehouse.

Located in Silver Spring, the 8,000 SF pantry is a choice grocery store allowing people who seek food assistance to choose their products. Designed by Giant Food, the new pantry is the fourth in the County and is located in an area that has twice the rate of food insecure residents. More than 20 employees were moved to the new Silver Spring location, allowing cubicles and conference rooms in the 12,000 SF Gaithersburg distribution warehouse to be repurposed to better serve neighbors in need.

As Project Manager, MGAC was tasked with overseeing subconsultants and vendors and maintaining the project schedule and budget. The two project sites were located roughly 25 miles from one another, requiring extensive coordination with Manna to remain open for donations throughout construction. The project also faced potential setbacks to the schedule due to delayed pieces of mechanical equipment. Through the relationships the MGAC project team had at the manufacturer plant, we were able to elevate the situation to a high level which resulted in the shipment being expedited to a truck immediately. This saved the project from a severe schedule setback.

The grand opening featured a ribbon cutting ceremony followed by tours and a community block party. Prominent guests in attendance included Senator Chris Van Hollen, Delegate Lorig Charkoudian, County Executive Marc Elrich, and County Council President Nancy Navarro.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All too often, building technology is a topic to be revisited at a later phase in construction projects. Fifty years ago, laying and raising a building foundation took precedence over its technological needs. Today, the built environment is increasingly intertwined in technology, requiring a much more strategic and proactive focus than ever before. It is essential to prioritize technology solutions long before boots hit the ground. Here are four reasons why:
<h5>1. If technology is addressed too late, concessions must be made.</h5>
All too often, technology requirements are not even discussed — let alone understood — until much later in the design process. At that point, there are often concessions that must be made, as adequate budget and space have not been allocated for equipment, pathways, and infrastructure support. Anticipating the end user experience and understanding specific use cases during the concept design phase is the best place to start. Technology should be a key project component, with equal importance to electrical and mechanical trades.

If designed incorrectly, a poor technology infrastructure can actually limit the building’s connectivity and flexibility for future renovations and expansions. All aspects of the technology infrastructure design must be carefully considered including pathways, server rooms, telecommunications rooms, MPOE rooms, meet-me rooms, AV infrastructure spaces, security systems and support spaces, conference rooms, meeting rooms, collaboration spaces, and executive support spaces.
<h5>2. Technology changes faster than buildings do.</h5>
Technology is a wide umbrella with a vast number of things underneath it, ranging from IT to audio-visual to security. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) the number of connected devices in a typical building is increasing with every new build. Advancements in these areas are made daily, so it’s vital to enlist experts who have a strong pulse on emerging technology in the built environment.

Today’s buildings must be constructed for more connection and interactivity than ever before while accommodating future technology. Attention to detail is critical, even for things as seemingly minor as leaving extra room in cabling pathways for potential additions, adding extra USB and USB-C ports for more mobile devices, or ensuring that Wi-Fi networks are capable of accommodating future advancement in wireless technology.
<h5>3. Technology is increasingly important to creating a user-friendly space.</h5>
Technology has significantly improved the effectiveness and longevity of modern When implemented correctly, technology infrastructure can impact an organization’s business objectives, bottom line, productivity, and culture.

To ensure that everything is correctly set up from the get-go, your technology team must know the right questions to ask, be familiar with the very best technology on the market, and work independently from vendors to ensure impartial solutions for your unique space. Having a strategic technology plan in place makes all the difference in the long run.
<h5>4. Traditional workplaces are a thing of the past.</h5>
We no longer sit at desks all day to perform our duties. The number of wireless connected devices that each of us carry, which are essential for our job, has increased. Many workers are mobile or remote, and rarely enter an office. Those who do go to an office each day are collaborating more than ever. Each scenario presents a unique challenge to the systems that support modern workspaces, and ultimately, to workplace designers.

When engaging with a technology team early in the process, client collaborations are more effective, allowing for detailed requirements review, better solution recommendations, accurate budgets, and technology requirements are incorporated into the design process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">MGAC is thrilled to announce the hire of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-slack-7943451/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Slack</a> as Senior Vice President. Jessica comes to MGAC with 14 years of experience in real estate and construction. She first entered this field serving as the Director of Sales &amp; Marketing for P. Agnes Incorporated in Philadelphia, and was later promoted to become their Associate Vice President of Strategic Development. Following her success in the Philadelphia market, Watchdog, a real estate project management firm, hired her as Managing Director to open and develop their second office in Los Angeles. As Senior Vice President, Jessica will provide strategic leadership in supporting the growth of MGAC’s Los Angeles office, as well as building and supporting the local team.</p>
<p class="p1">“As I learned more about MGAC, I was thoroughly impressed with their people and their leadership team, and I think that is what sets them apart,” says Jessica. “This is an exceptional opportunity to support MGAC’s growth, while working alongside people who truly want to support my efforts and see me succeed. I am eager to apply the market knowledge and experience I have gained, while leveraging the extensive relationships I have established, and the firm’s vast resources to ensure our clients receive the superior service they expect.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Upon meeting Jessica, it was immediately clear that she is highly driven, focused, and relentless in her pursuit of a project. She has a contagious energy and we are excited to have her bring her talents to our Los Angeles team,” says<a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mark Anderson</a>, MGAC Founder and President. In addition to the constant evolution and continuous learning that working in the construction field provides, Jessica also enjoys the gratification of seeing a project through from the start. However, what she most enjoys is knowing that her work is truly bringing her clients' dreams to life.</p>
<p class="p1">Jessica is a Board Member of the Los Angeles Headquarters Association, a Broker Challenge Planning Committee Member of the Los Angeles Commercial Real Estate Association, and a Committee Member of the Urban Land Institute Los Angeles, Women’s Leadership Initiative. Outside of the office, she enjoys volunteering for local animal rescue organizations, doing anything fitness-related, singing, and spending time with friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3178" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMBh318VAAYAhbo.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" />MGAC and T-Mobile have been collaborating since 2018 to deliver their new Bellevue campus renovation, and this week, we officially opened the doors to Building 1, revealing the new entrance and lobby! T-Mobile USA CEO John Legere called the new entrance “better than expectation,” and we’re thrilled to celebrate this major milestone moment as we work towards bringing the T-Mobile brand to life for over 6,000 employees and their visitors.
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3156" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-12-19-12.54.14.png" alt="" width="530" height="722" /></p>
<p class="p1">When guests arrive, they’ll be met with a dramatic circular entryway and an attention-grabbing lit magenta T, as well as a line of magenta lights framing the entrance. Designed by <a href="https://www.gensler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gensler</a>, the lobby welcomes visitors with a comfortable waiting area, plenty of tables and seating, a fireplace and a flatscreen TV.</p>
<p class="p1">“This is an exciting milestone for us as this new entrance is unmistakably T-Mobile and demonstrates the company's commitment to creating a welcoming atmosphere for employees and guests. There are many more milestones we're looking forward to as we progress in the ongoing campus renovation, but this one is special as it stands as a can't-be-missed representation of T-Mobile's vision,” said <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O’Connor</a>, MGAC Managing Director.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond the main entrance, MGAC also coordinated updates to the parking garage, which include electronic signage outside of the garage and an IoT parking solution that is updated regularly via the Luum app, ensuring that employees always know where there are available spaces. Further renovations will include the construction of an innovative and dynamic customer experience center and the introduction of a 40,000 SF campus amenity centerpiece with food and dining options, gaming, and collaborating meeting space.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to providing project management and owner’s representation services, MGAC is also collaborating with T-Mobile on cost and risk management, procurement, technology solutions, and change management communication and messaging, as well as managing all project partners, budgets and timelines.</p>
<p class="p1">View the stunning before and after pictures of the new headquarters below, and watch the change in action in this <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/TMUS-Front-Door.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timelapse video</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope </em>their<em> lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-g-anderson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, Founder and President of MGAC.</em>

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>You’re the first person in our Impact blog series! That’s exciting. Let’s start by getting a brief background on how your career got started, and what led you to found MGAC.

<strong>Mark Anderson: </strong>Wow, that’s a long story. I worked summers when I was in college—in Washington, in construction—and DC was a union town back then, so for someone right out of high school, trying to make money for college, construction was a great place to be.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>That makes sense.

<strong>MA:</strong> So I was a physics major in school, and when I was a junior, I started thinking about what I was going to do post-graduation. I looked at going into particle physics… but then I started thinking about how I really enjoyed the spectrum of people and projects that I had experienced in the construction world, so I did informational interviews with alumni of my college who were in the construction industry. And that led me to joining a large general contractor here in Washington, DC when I graduated school. I was so happy to be out of college, but of course I immediately went back to grad school at night in engineering administration and project management.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGA</strong><strong>C:</strong></span> Ha, of course.

<strong>MA: </strong>And oddly, I have a paper here on my shelf that's called “the effects of construction consultants on the building process,” or something like that, that predicts the growing rise of consultants in the construction industry. Which is kind of odd, thinking now that I wrote that in my mid-20s.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> Oh wow, it’s like you knew! Even back then.

<strong>MA: </strong>Yeah. So later, when I was trying to get out of that job, I started getting calls from past clients and former bosses, and they were calling with different opportunities. So I started commuting to New York, to the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the 1993 bombings, working on issues in the World Trade Center and trying to bring those buildings up to the late 20th century. And at the same time, I got a phone call from Discovery Channel asking if I’d interview for the coolest, grooviest project they had going on in Washington, DC. And I remember interviewing with Discovery Channel—we didn’t even have a business card, we had nothing—and I went home that weekend thinking, ‘There’s just no possible way this is going to happen.’ But they called me that weekend and said, ‘Well, we interviewed you guys, and we interviewed Walt Disney Company.’ And I just thought to myself, ‘Well, okay. It’s all done now.’

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> Yeah! Tough competition.

<strong>MA:</strong> Yeah. But then they said, ‘We like you both for different reasons. So we’d like you to go to dinner with them next week and figure out how you can work together on this thing.’

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> So that was the game changer moment.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3192 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Quotes-e1582733337282.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="357" />

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> That’s a really great segue. How do you try to take care of and have a lasting impact on your employees? What motivates them?

<strong>MA:</strong> Well, we’ve created at least ten if not a dozen millionaires in our profit-sharing program for people who have been with us a long time and have really just grown up with the company. Longevity with the firm is a path to financial security. I can’t think of another company that has a profit-sharing program as generous as ours. I think that makes a big difference.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Right, absolutely. That’s life changing.

<strong>MA: </strong>It is. But at the same time, money isn’t everything. It's all about working with really smart people and being challenged all the time by really great clients and really great projects.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> What are some of those really great projects you’ve worked on over the years that made a big impact on you and MGAC? Projects that impacted the trajectory of the company?

<strong>MA: </strong>Ha! There’s been a lot. Certainly the work we did at the local NBA / NHL arena in the mid-90s was a game changer in terms of growing the company. That was huge. Similarly, I think branching out and doing geographically diverse projects. By 2000, we were doing projects in the UK and Europe. And that really set us apart. And of course, there were big, key projects along the way that touched off entire market verticals.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>I’ve heard through the grapevine that you’ve recently become very interested in conscious capitalism.

<strong>MA:</strong> Oh, yeah.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> I’m interested to hear your thoughts on that.

<strong>MA: </strong>The basics and tenants of conscious capitalism are things that we’ve always practiced. So I don’t want to say the world is coming to see things our way, but maybe the world is coming closer to seeing things the way we do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>So, in a way, you’ve always kind of practiced this.

<strong>MA: </strong>Oh, yeah. Businesses can’t just be all about the shareholders. It has to be about all the stakeholders in the organization, including communities, employees, and shareholders. Which is a major departure from what has been the chiseled-in-stone mantra of business for the last forty years.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Yeah, it’s a major shift.

<strong>MA: </strong>It has to take into account communities, colleagues, and our clients. And I say it’s really four legs of a table, the last leg being the company. In no particular order. I don’t think businesses that neglect any one of those are being as good of a business as they can be. So we have to be aware of and work towards an ideal balance of company, community, colleagues, and clients. Does that make sense?

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Makes total sense. I like that. So through that lens of conscious capitalism, what are you hoping MGAC’s lasting impact will be? Based on those four C’s, it has to go beyond just your day-to-day work, right? How are you currently forging what you hope to be your future legacy?

<strong>MA: </strong>Our business changes lives in many different ways. We have a great impact on a lot of what our clients do, whether it's a business goal or a personal desire. We’ve built some iconic things. So that’s certainly something people remember.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Absolutely.

<strong>MA:</strong> But, we’ve also had employees who have gone through extraordinarily difficult personal circumstances. You know, the death of family members. Sickness, things like that. And I think we take care of those employees. We take care of those families. We create lasting financial security for an awful lot of people. So that’s a lasting legacy.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> You create a lasting impact on your people.

<strong>MA: </strong>Right. And when I look at our community involvement, whether it’s building playgrounds in underprivileged neighborhoods… I mean, MGAC has put, I can’t even tell you how many kids through college who otherwise wouldn’t have gone on scholarship. <em>That </em>creates a lasting impact.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>That’s amazing. So what gives <em>you</em> energy? What makes you get out of bed in the morning?

<strong>MA: </strong>I could be flippant and say my alarm clock.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Well, that’s honest.

<strong>MA: </strong>The alarm clock hits between 4:15AM and 5:00AM, and then I’m in the gym.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Wow, early riser.

<strong>MA: </strong>That’s a big part of staying busy, to me, is the mental health that the gym and exercise creates.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That’s great.

<strong>MA: </strong>I also tend to be a deal junkie, so I always want to see the win. But more recently, those wins are less project-based and more company-based, as the nature of what I do has changed. So that means working to geographically expand offices. Finding the best talent and keeping people working in the company and being motivated, that’s a big thing. We have some special people working in this company.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What is it about your people that makes them so uniquely special?

<strong>MA:</strong> I think getting hired at MGAC is largely more selective than getting into Harvard. We work very hard to be the employer of choice, but we are also very careful with who we hire. We really look for the rockstars.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong> </span>Are there certain qualities you always look for when you hire? Certain things that bind all MGAC employees together?

<strong>MA:</strong> No, not really. Our diversity is our strength.

&nbsp;
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Okay, now some rapid-fire questions.</h3>
&nbsp;

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> Name a book that changed your life.

<strong>MA: </strong>Tough one. Most of what I read is pulp fiction… not the movie, just crap novels. Okay, I do frequently quote “The World is Flat” by Tom Friedman. He got a lot right, but unfortunately a lot of what he predicted as risk has come to pass as well.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>What about a quote that inspires you?

<strong>MA: </strong>“Success is never final” by Churchill. Or, “We are masters of the unspoken word and slaves to the ones that slip out,” also Churchill.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>MA:</strong> People make the world turn.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>MA:</strong> Try to say hello to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgia-axiotis-62105693/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gia</a>! Then black coffee, no sugar.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>What’s the last thing?

<strong>MA: </strong>Encourage <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruce-bieber-leed-ap-436a994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Bieber</a> to leave at a reasonable hour.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> What's the strangest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>MA:</strong> A piece of a scrapped 767 I once flew on, with my name on it. American Airlines mailed it to me. Kind of cool.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> What don’t you leave the house without?

<strong>MA: </strong>Hmm, I would say clothing, but that might not be 100% true. I usually wear a watch.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up just 10.3% of the construction industry workforce. MGAC is proud to report that 34% of our workforce is female. That is more than three times the industry standard.

MGAC has built entire teams under the direction of female leadership. We have broken ground on projects almost entirely staffed by women. These individuals and their incredible management, guidance, and tireless efforts have greatly contributed to making MGAC everything it is today. We are grateful to be surrounded by such talented women, who each and every day, continue to push the envelope to make the greatest impacts possible in the communities we serve.

During this Women in Construction Week, we extend our gratitude to each of our female employees. Below, meet a handful of these women who choose to be a part of our family and hear what they have to say about being a woman in construction today.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vindhya-juvaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vindhya Juvaa</strong></a> is an Assistant Project Manager at MGAC in DC who has witnessed firsthand a shift in culture regarding women in the industry. Juvaa says she is glad to see more female superintendents on the ground and to see safety equipment designed with women in mind. That said, she knows there are many misconceptions floating around about women in the industry—particularly when it comes to the job site. “There’s a misconception that women aren’t welcome and don’t like to be at the job site. I totally disagree and have always loved being at the job site. It’s where you see how a project is doing and where you can literally watch a building grow from start to finish.” During this Women In Construction Week, Juvaa hopes to give a special shout out to her first Project Manager, Melanie Felix. Her advice to women in the industry? Never give up.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-wieneke-pmp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Liz Haeck</strong></a> is a Project Manager based in MGAC’s Seattle office who is often accustomed to being the only woman at the table. Haeck says that rather than feeling out of place, she reminds herself how important it is to bring her perspective to these meetings—especially considering she is usually the one leading the conversation! When asked about what misconceptions she runs into related to being a woman in the industry, she told us, “When I describe what I do to people outside of the industry, they are always surprised to learn that I sport a hard hat and safety vest on a regular basis, as if I’m ‘too feminine’ to belong in that type of uniform. There is this misconception that women have to fit a certain stereotype of being ‘tough’ in order to be in construction, when in fact, there is such a wide range of personality types and backgrounds, roles and experience levels, that all make up the industry!” Haeck believes that women can better support other women in the industry by thinking like a team working towards a common goal, while taking every opportunity to lift each other up.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandey-rodgers-mcdonald-b3b83a8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brandey McDonald</strong></a> is a DC-based Project Manager for MGAC. When considering what will lead to the continued success of women in the industry, McDonald always returns to mentorship. In her own career, McDonald had one mentor who made a big impact on her life. “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-marcus-34a6433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn Marcus</a>, former Director of Communications at Hines, helped me get to where I am today. As both a fellow former President of the African American Real Estate Professionals and a cheerleader, Dawn made sure I was placed in front of the right individuals, which helped me continue to grow my brand. I am so very thankful for her!” McDonald wants other women in construction to know that it can take time to build your confidence in the field because it is not always easy to be underrepresented. She reassuringly adds that with time, she came to realize that the things that made her different were actually her greatest and most valuable assets. We could not agree more.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanetmartinez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Yanet Martinez</strong></a> works in MGAC’s Los Angeles office as an Assistant Project Manager. She is proud to work in the construction industry because it means playing a pivotal role in the transformation of cities. Despite construction being a predominantly male industry, she believes it is highly important for women to have a seat at the table. After all, they will make up at least half of the population who will one day utilize the spaces being built. Martinez, like Haeck, believes that the biggest misconception about being a woman in construction is that they do not like to be on site, or perhaps are not interested in the industry at all. As someone who came up in design, Martinez observed that men were always the ones being tasked with on-site construction administration responsibilities. She believes this was not intentional, but rather a subconscious decision based on old gender-based stereotypes. To continue progressing in the industry, Martinez would encourage businesses to continue hiring women and appointing women to leadership roles. When reflecting on her professional growth, Martinez acknowledges <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinel-robinson-a84a174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marinel Santos-Robinson</a> as someone who helped her realize her potential at her former workplace and helped determine a road map to reach her goals. She also adds, “I have to say that I’ve also been fortunate to have male mentors who believed in my abilities and helped guide my career. They’ve been just as important to my growth and success as the many women who have helped along the way.”

Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-parra-01bb2516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gabriella Parra</strong></a> is a Project Manager in MGAC’s DC office. Parra is proud to work alongside many female colleagues at MGAC and echoed their sentiments about industry stereotypes. “The biggest misconception about being a woman in construction is that oftentimes, people on the job site don’t think you know how things are constructed. Though women rarely provide manual labor on job sites, they can easily draw from our management experience to provide solutions for any construction issues that arise.” When discussing what can be done to help lift up other women in the industry, Parra also stressed the importance of mentorship and suggests that women should take the opportunity to expose themselves to a variety of projects. She believes that each job site and every project presents a unique learning opportunity. When asked about a woman who helped her get to where she is today, she gave a shout out to MGAC’s own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristina-leighty-62526912/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristina Leighty</a>, one of our Senior Vice Presidents. “I was lucky enough to meet Kristina Leighty, a great project manager who became my mentor when I first transitioned to project management from engineering. Kristina had me shadow her at meetings, site visits, etc. so I could see how the process worked and how she handled all situations on a project. I was able to become the project manager I am today thanks to her guidance and advice. We continue to work together and bounce ideas off of each other with great ease and comfort.”

So, this Women In Construction Week, we would like to thank these women for sharing their insight and hope to collectively do a better job of supporting the women in our industry. Let’s welcome them to job sites with open arms, foster opportunities for mentorship, and challenge outdated stereotypes. If there is a woman who helped you arrive where you landed, now is a great time to let them know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Los Angeles office spent Sunday, February 23rd with </span><strong><a href="https://www.treepeople.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TreePeople</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an environmental non-profit organization whose mission is to inspire, engage, and support people to take personal responsibility for the urban environment. During our morning in the Santa Monica Mountains, we helped to restore the native Southern California landscape in Calabasas, clearing brush to help prevent the spread of future fires, as well as planting oak trees. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our relationship with TreePeople started in 2019, when MGAC decided to do something a little different for our client holiday gifts. Instead of traditional presents, we selected non-profits in four of our office locations—Washington, DC; Los Angeles; Seattle; and Toronto—and made a $10,000 donation to each. Since selecting TreePeople in Los Angeles, we have been honored to partner with the non-profit through volunteering efforts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in volunteering with TreePeople, </span><strong><a href="https://www.treepeople.org/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">register for an upcoming event</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong><a href="https://www.treepeople.org/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the community</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, you have decided you need a project manager for your project. We applaud your decision as having a project manager on board is the best possible way to ensure your project meets its two most important goals: finishing on time and on budget.

That said, choosing a project manager is a big decision. It is important you find someone who is communicative, easy to work with and, ultimately, is someone you and your stakeholders can trust to get the job done. Here are some questions you might like to ask to determine if a potential project manager is right for you.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>1. What are some of the biggest challenges you have overcome in the past? </strong></span>

This is a great question to ask to get a little background knowledge on their work experience and will help you to get a sense of their ability to think on their feet. Almost every larger project is going to have some kind of unforeseen circumstances crop up along the way so it is important you have someone on your side that is able to step up to the plate should things move off course for any reason. If they tell you they have never worked on a project that has been challenging in some way or another, they might not have the kind of experience you are looking for—or worse, they might not be telling you the whole story.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>2. Do you have references we may contact?</strong></span>

This one is really a no brainer; it is important to take the time to check in with former clients to see if they were satisfied with this project manager. A good project manager should work closely with their clients to develop solid relationships so it should be no problem for them to provide references to you.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3. What can I expect in terms of regular communication?</strong></span>

Consistent and transparent communication is one of the most important components of a successful partnership with a project manager. A good project manager should be able to tell you exactly what to expect when it comes to getting updates and should be flexible to meet your needs when it comes to providing those updates in a way that works best for your team.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>4. What are your thoughts on the project? What are you most excited about and what concerns come to mind?</strong></span>

Ideally, you need a project manager who is going to care as much about this project as you do—and ideally, even more. They should be receptive to your vision and enthusiastic about the end goal. If that energy is not there from the get-go it is not likely to be there months, or even years, down the line. Additionally, it is a project manager’s job to give informed and honest feedback at all times. As we mentioned earlier, it is rare for a project to make it to the finish line without even one small hiccup along the way and it is the project manager’s job to envision 100 potential hiccups from a mile away—and then do everything in their power to prevent them. So, if they cannot think of a single concern right off the bat, they are probably not thinking hard enough and you should probably look to a new candidate.

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5. What experience do you have that lends well to this project?</strong></span>

Sure, if you are building a glitter factory in a super remote location with sub-zero temperatures, this is probably not a project they have in their portfolio. That said, a good project manager should be able to draw from their previous work experience for each new job, whatever the job. They might not have worked on a glitter factory, but maybe they can tell you they have worked on a project that required a sharp focus on workplace efficiency or strict safety features that needed to be considered. They might not have completed a build in the middle of nowhere, but perhaps they have experience in bringing materials or equipment in from far away. And, finally, maybe they have not worked in sub-zero temperatures, but maybe they have worked in a place that rains a ton or is really really hot and needed to accommodate accordingly. Whatever the case may be, you are going to want someone with experience that is solid enough to make your glitter factory a reality.

So, there you have it. Those are the five most important questions to ask a project manager candidate. Ideally, your conversation should lead to even more questions and discussion naturally as this should be someone that is easy to connect with and is interested enough in your vision to want to discuss it at length. This person is going to be in it with you on this project for the long haul, so you will want to be sure you can see yourself not only happy to have them there for the ride—but ready to have them help lead the journey.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope </em>their<em> lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>--</em>

<em>NOTE: As you all know, lives across the world have been impacted drastically over the last few weeks due to the spread of COVID-19. Every industry has been affected—including ours. However, in the midst of the chaos, we have decided to resume our Impact blog series—not just in spite of this outbreak, but because of it. We know that the positive impact we make on our friends, families, and communities during this difficult time is more important now than ever. So please join us as we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-olivet-a4316218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Olivet</a>, Vice President at MGAC.</em>

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> Hey, Rob. What a week we have had! How are you doing?

<strong>Rob Olivet: </strong>Doing okay!

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span>Well, these are crazy times, but we appreciate you still taking the time to talk with us today.

<strong>RO: </strong>Of course.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Let’s start with hearing about what you do at MGAC. What’s your role?

<strong>RO: </strong>Sure. I manage a team based out of the DC office, working on everything from small fit-out projects to large base building construction. We onboarded a new member to our team the first day we were all working from home, so that was quite an interesting day one. She'll probably never forget it.

<span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span> I can only imagine. I know these aren’t normal times right now, but <em>normally, </em>what takes up most of your time?

<strong>RO:</strong> Well, a lot of things. But I’d say most of my time is spent supporting my team and making sure they are positioned well to lead, manage and deliver these projects. We are all committed to our projects and to our clients, and at the end of the day, our clients hire us to be their trusted advisor and advocate, managing projects on their behalf. So a lot of my time is focused on that client engagement to ensure our team and our clients are setup to be successful.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That brings up a good point. How has the COVID-19 outbreak affected your work? I’m sure, right now, it’s been exceptionally difficult to do many of those things.

<strong>RO: </strong>Yeah, it’s been interesting.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What are some things that this outbreak has taught you over this last week that you’re applying to your work?

<strong>RO:</strong> That’s a good question. Something that has always been critical to the success of any project, absent COVID-19, is communication. But now, we're getting inundated with notices from general contractors and clients and designers and architects and engineers, and everyone's approach to dealing with the situation is constantly evolving and changing. Working remote all the time teaches you how important regular touchpoints are, and also making sure all parties are coordinated based on accurate information. So, we're seeing the emphasis on communication being more important than ever right now, given the current state of affairs. It has always been critical, but it’s all the more important now, given where we are today.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That makes total sense. So how did you get started at MGAC? What has your career trajectory looked like?

<strong>RO: </strong>I spent the first part of my career in the construction industry in the DC area, working for a large GC. I was working on multiple projects within the City, mostly higher education projects. Then I got married and my wife got an opportunity overseas—this was before we had kids, before we had a family—so after much thought and deliberation, we took the plunge and went overseas. We had a great time, it was a great experience, and I was able to find work for a developer over there.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Where was <em>there</em>?

<strong>RO:</strong> We were in Scotland. I ran a team managing the infrastructure work on a 2,000-acre site, so that opened my eyes to the owner’s side of the table. When we made the decision to come back, I reached out to some prior DC contacts I had and asked for recommendations for companies that do that on a large scale, and I was referred to MGAC. A mutual colleague synced Mark and I up and we went from there. The rest, as they say, is history.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Seems pretty serendipitous. What year was that?

<strong>RO: </strong>We moved back to DC in 2015.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> What do you find most rewarding about this job?

<strong>RO:</strong> I recently led the relocation of The Urban Institute’s headquarters in Downtown DC, and it was the first time they had a major relocation in their history, since their founding in 1968. They have an incredible mission solving some of the most challenging and complex problems in society and making a big impact in communities in the district and elsewhere. So being able to work with an organization like that—getting to help them in their mission, getting their move to be as seamless as possible, getting them in their new building on time so they can continue their great work and have their 50 year celebration—that is a big part of what we do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That’s great.

<strong>RO:</strong> Yeah. Just making our clients' lives easier so they can continue to do what they do. We get to work with a lot of great non-profits in DC, each of whom are actively supporting the communities, which continues to be very rewarding. We really make their mission ours.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Is that what gets you out of bed in the morning? Making those missions yours?

<strong>RO:</strong> Yeah, there are a couple things. There isn’t just one thing for me. Each day I’m inspired by my family—my kids, my wife. Seeing them grow and develop day by day. My kids are young, so that certainly gives me energy. Also, working in a firm like MGAC, helping other folks in the community realize their missions. The work is always different; there's always a new challenge to address, always a new challenge to solve. And we don't run away from challenges and problems. We thrive on them. It's why we're here.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Let’s flip that question around—how do you wind down at night after a long day?

<strong>RO:</strong> There are some nights when I should probably wind down sooner than I do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>We’re all guilty of that.

<strong>RO:</strong> It goes back to my kids, probably. My wife and I both work, so picking them up and seeing the joy on their face. Coming home with them, putting them down to bed. It puts everything in perspective. I may dial-in after they go to bed—send some e-mails and whatnot—but at the end of the day, that's really what it's all about.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> We’ve talked a lot about impact today—the impact of the outbreak, the impact of the work MGAC does, and the impact of our clients in their communities. What do you want <em>your </em>lasting impact to be?

<strong>RO: </strong>That’s a profound question.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> It is!

<strong>RO:</strong> When you’re able to influence colleagues and co-workers and really see them grow, I think that's something to really be proud of. It’s not something that happens immediately, but over time, when you see something you taught somebody or helped somebody do, and you see them grow and carry that on, I think that's very rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Good answer. Are you ready for some rapid fire questions?

<strong>RO:</strong> Let’s go.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Name a book that changed your life.

<strong>RO:</strong> When I’m able to read, which isn't a ton with little kids right now, what I find really interesting are the biographies of folks who have made a big impact on society—Steve Jobs, Colin Powell, etc. I wouldn't say I'm a huge history buff, but reading about folks who have made a significant impact globally or who have transformed society is really interesting. I like seeing insights into what made them tick and what their motivations were.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>RO:</strong> Hmm, five words. It’s our mantra, but “trusted advisor.” Also, “bottle of aspirin.” That’s five words.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Ha! How about the first thing you do when you get into the office.

<strong>RO:</strong> The first thing I do... fire up my laptop and grab a cup of coffee.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>How about the last thing you do before you leave?

<strong>RO: </strong>As much as possible, I try to check in with any of my team members that are still there. To see if there is anything they need from me before I check out for a little bit.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Go-to lunch order?

<strong>RO:</strong> It’s gotta be Potbelly. Quick, easy, efficient.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Love Potbelly. What’s the go-to order there?

<strong>RO:</strong> Turkey and swiss.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Most used app on your phone?

<strong>RO:</strong> I would probably say the News app, or maybe Waze. Coming into DC, I know about 15 different ways at this point, but depending on traffic, it can change by the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>The most unique thing we may find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>RO:</strong> The most unique thing… I’m not sure if there’s anything really unique that I keep. Sorry, I’m kind of lame on that one.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Where do you see yourself in five years?

<strong>RO: </strong>Another profound question. Going back to some of your earlier questions, within the firm and for myself personally, I see myself helping MGAC’s footprint grow. Within DC and nationally. We do work all over the globe, and have done billions of dollars of work within the last five years, but that still only represents a fraction of the potential out there. I want to build teams that can be successful and autonomous. That’s where I want to be.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-villegas-19583732/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabella Villegas</a> as MGAC’s newest Vice President of Project Management. Isabella earned her Bachelor of Environmental Studies and Bachelor of Architecture at the University of Waterloo, as well as her Project Management Professional Designation at the University of Toronto. She comes to MGAC with 16 years of experience in project and program management, having run projects ranging from 7,000 SF to 1,200,000 SF at companies including Stantec, Halsall Engineering (now WSP), and Zeidler Partnership. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At MGAC, Isabella will be leading a team of project managers in our Toronto office, supporting the team and our clients </span>with the development and/or renovation of projects <span style="font-weight: 400;">from conception through move-in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“MGAC’s portfolio of work and dedicated team is so great,” says Isabella. “The amount of clients that reach out to MGAC for help is a testament to the trust that they have built within the industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and trust from both your clients and your peers is something that is very meaningful to me as I take on this role.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The entire Toronto office, and MGAC at large, has already welcomed Isabella with open arms,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, MGAC Founder and President. “Isabella is a high energy professional and a source of constant positivity and support to our people—which is something we truly value in our leaders. The team is lucky to have her.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabella was born in a small town in Northern Ontario called Sault Ste. Marie, ON, but spent the majority of her childhood living in Mexico. She currently resides in Toronto, and she hopes that her lasting legacy will be to plan and implement projects that will support the growth of her community in a positive way. Outside of work, she enjoys hanging out with her family—especially her four-year-old daughter, Nova—watching basketball, attending her soccer practices, and trying new recipes.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The current COVID-19 crisis has affected lives and industries across the world—including ours. As we continue to monitor the effects of the virus, MGAC is committed to doing our part to stop the spread, while also maintaining a high quality of work for our clients across the globe. And, we firmly believe that both can be done simultaneously: social distancing by working remotely while also staying busy, staying productive, and staying the course.

To our clients, however this situation affects your business, know that we are here to help. From leaning into technology like Bluebeam, FaceTime, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and/or Zoom to allow for electronic documentation and onsite problem-solving to relying on good old-fashioned telephone calls to replace in-person meetings, we as a company remain confident in our ability to make your missions real.

There are many unknowns right now. New questions are being asked every day that we do not yet have the answers to—is a viral outbreak a compensable delay on a construction project? What happens if a contractor does not want to work on a site they consider “contaminated?” What effects do government directives have on ongoing construction projects? What about a supply chain disruption? We know that the only constant right now is that there is no constant; things will continue to change. But, what we also know is this—MGAC has always risen to a challenge, and this one is no different. Together, we will make it through.

For more information, please read our full <a href="https://mailchi.mp/mgac/mgacservicecontinuityplan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Continuity Plan</a>.

Stay healthy and stay busy!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As COVID-19 continues to impact all aspects of daily life, commercial real estate and construction professionals are grappling with new challenges as they design, build, and maintain their facilities. As professional project managers and owners’ advocates, all of us here at MGAC are used to helping our clients navigate and solve problems—and while we are living during an unprecedented crisis right now, our mission remains the same.

That is why, over the next few weeks, we will be sharing information from our COVID-19 Task Force on how the coronavirus outbreak is and will continue to affect our work and industry—as well as how to best deal with the upcoming challenges. We talked to people with boots on the ground—such as contractors, subcontractors, vendors, and owners—in order to gain a clear understanding of the current commercial landscape. We have seen that new construction and renovation projects may be confronted with supply chain disruptions and staff shortages. We have heard from owners who may experience reduced funding capacity due to diminished revenue or tightened credit standards. As this crisis continues to unfold, this list will likely expand. However, as the challenges are better understood, we also know that innovative solutions will be developed to allow for operations and critical projects to proceed.

To start, let’s discuss some basic industry trends we have seen emerge across the country, as well as how COVID-19 is and will continue to affect health and wellness across jobsites.
<h5><strong>Impacts Across States and Industries</strong></h5>
Here at MGAC, we have offices in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington DC, and Toronto—all of which have been hit with varying degrees of cases, rules, and restrictions. To begin, it is important to understand which states have deemed construction essential. You can find that information <a href="https://www.constructconnect.com/covid-19-construction-activity-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

For example, <a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark Construction</a>, one of the nation’s largest contractors, has seen varying impacts to jobsite labor in locations across the country over the last several weeks, but overall labor is trending back up and should continue to rise once Seattle jobs are back online next week—with measures in place to comply with Governor Inslee's requirements.

In addition to working in various cities and states, MGAC also works across many different sectors, and we have seen varying COVID-19 implications on a project-to-project basis. So far, the projects that have been most affected are projects in hospitality, luxury living, gaming, events, aviation, and culture. However, despite these setbacks, we have also seen some owners take advantage of this time by renovating properties more quickly and cost-effectively than they could have when fully operational—such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation with limited cars and trains.
<h5><strong>Impacts on Health and Wellness</strong></h5>
Now more than ever, health and wellness are and will be paramount throughout all phases of the commercial real estate cycle. To ensure all projects are maintaining the highest standards of health and safety, we have seen project managers create the new role of “health marshal” on their jobsites. Health marshals are charged with monitoring the health of the site crews through daily temperature checks, respiratory illness tracking, ensuring use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and establishing protocols for crews to maintain social distancing. <a href="https://hitt.com/peter-lanfranchi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Lanfranchi</a>, Senior Vice President of Hospitality for <a href="https://hitt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HITT</a> based in Falls Church, Virginia, reported that his teams are already implementing new health and safety measures at their jobsites, including adding a health marshal, as well as requiring staff to wear face masks. By creating the health marshal role, many project managers have been able to continue servicing clients and moving critical projects forward.

With this renewed emphasis on cleanliness and personal hygiene, we envision construction sites will need to continue to adapt even further to meet construction personnel expectations. General contractors may need to consider adding hand sanitizing stations or portable hand washing facilities throughout sites to promote healthy habits. Enhanced cleaning procedures may be implemented to reduce probability of indirect transmission of the virus from surfaces, and certain high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, door handles, handrails, worksurfaces, and tools should be cleaned and sanitized daily.

In addition, project teams may elect to configure construction schedules to allow for multiple shifts to decrease the number of staff on site at any time to further reduce opportunities for disease spread. On March 17<sup>th</sup>, NIH released information on the lifecycle of the virus in various materials. Following the release of this information, <a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark Construction</a>, instituted four-day work weeks on closed-in projects or ones in tight quarters. This allows three days for the lifespan of the virus to diminish and limits the number of days people are on site to support greater social distancing. They termed it “go slow to go fast” in an effort to avoid a longer-term shutdown of a project. Read <a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/clarks-response-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark’s Response to COVID-19</a> to learn more about the steps they are taking to ensure a safe, controlled, and healthy work environment.

However, despite general contractors’ best efforts, some staff may become infected with COVID-19. Proactive project teams should develop protocols for removing infected team members from jobsites, tracing contact throughout the jobsite to reduce the spread of infection, and supplementing crews while infected personnel recover. For example, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-grab-21a48a33/">Tom Grab</a>, a project executive at <a href="https://hitt.com/">HITT</a>, reported that on a recent hotel renovation project in New Haven, Connecticut his team took advantage of low-occupancy rates and had the construction staff housed at the hotel, which reduced opportunities for disease transmission, as well as increased opportunities for illness tracking.

Next in this series, we will explore the impacts of COVID-19 on everything from project scheduling to costs, contracts, and future planning considerations.

Part III: Impacts on Cost
Part IV: Impacts on Contracts

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, we introduced our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/coping-with-covid-19-in-the-construction-industry/">Coping with COVID-19 in the Construction Industry</a> series. As we mentioned, over the next few weeks, we will be bringing you timely content from our COVID-19 Task Force on navigating the new challenges brought on by the coronavirus crisis. One of the timeliest topics to tackle for many projects currently being impacted by the continued spread of the coronavirus is scheduling, so that is what we will delve into today.

We have talked before about how essential proper <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/schedule-management/">schedule management</a> is to a successful project completion, and that is even more true as we face this new normal. During this unprecedented time, it is inevitable that construction schedules will be impacted due to supply chain disruption, reduced workforce, material shortages, new safety protocols, reduced productivity, and other snowball effects. Understandably, owners are worried about the impact on their schedule and how that might translate to a potential increase in project costs and contractual issues. The following schedule guidelines and steps will help mitigate possible questions later in the year and into 2021.

<strong>HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW, AND IN THE COMING WEEKS, TO GET AHEAD ON MEETING THIS</strong><strong> CHALLENGE.</strong>

<strong>Update the Schedule Now:</strong> MGAC has advised owners to update their schedule now to provide a benchmark going forward. Even if you are not sure of all of the eventual delays you may face, you will want to update this as best as you can and seek agreement on the revised schedule by all responsible parties. As the impact of the coronavirus continues to unfold, you will want to continue updating the schedule and stay in constant communication with all responsible parties. This continued effort will help to gather more data and facilitate more informed decisions.

<strong>Validate the Critical Path Forward:</strong> Defining the necessary critical path forward will help the owner to identify activities that <em>must</em> be completed on time in order to meet the key project milestones. Those critical activities that are highly susceptible to delay due to COVID-19 should become the highest priority items to address.

<strong>Breakdown the Schedule:</strong> Next, you will need to break down the schedule by capturing all activities associated with the various parties on the project. This will help forecast key milestones for the project, determine if the schedule is realistic and if re-sequencing is needed to mitigate the crew flow constraints. This task can also help identify key off-site design and procurement activities that can progress during closure and assist in a speedy recovery when work restarts.

<strong>Keep Detailed Records:</strong> Maintaining accurate records is critical in reaching a reasonable agreement for compensating impacted parties. This could include tracking labor hours, equipment and material availability, progress photographs, and meeting minutes. The more information is gathered, the easier potential change orders are to negotiate 12 months down the road.

<strong>HERE IS HOW TO ASSESS COVID-19 SCHEDULE DELAY CLAIMS BY THE CONTRACTOR.</strong>

The contractor may claim for time extensions due to the COVID-19 impact on project performance. Therefore, the owner needs to perform two key steps as noted below:

<strong>Entitlement:</strong> Additional activity delay may be possible due to COVID-19. However, the owner should consider if the activity was already late due to contractor error. If the activity was on time originally and was to finish before COVID-19 affected the project, this is likely not a reasonable claim that should result in owner payout.

<strong>Quantification</strong><strong>:</strong> There are two types of delays: Pure Delays and Disruptive Delays.

<strong>Pure Delays</strong> are easy to quantify delays that include delay in procurement of material / equipment, delayed issuance of permits, or job shutdown. A fragnet <em>(defined as the sequence of new activities that are proposed to be added to the existing schedule) </em>can be inserted into the schedule to track the pure delay and also forecast the realistically achievable dates in the project.

<strong>Disruptive Delays</strong> include loss of productivity. These would stem from several factors like distance requirements, working in the staggered form, limited availability of labor, etc. This will lead to productivity loss and therefore delay the project schedule. In this scenario, a detailed resource-loaded schedule will assist in analyzing productivity loss quickly. However, several other methodologies can be used to substantiate a loss of productivity. The Measured Mile method is widely used and accepted in the construction industry to quantify disruptive delays. This method compares the productivity in the non-impacted period to productivity in the impacted period. The primary advantage of this method is that it uses the actual man-hours rather than the initially estimated man-hours. Therefore, the owner should track the labor hours to quantify Disruptive Delays. Other recognized methodologies include earned value analysis, comparison studies, and baseline productivity analysis.

<strong>FINALLY, HERE IS HOW YOU CAN MITIGATE SCHEDULE IMPACT DUE TO COVID-19.</strong>

The full impact of the pandemic is not yet clear at this stage, but we know there will be impacts on project performances and likely disputes with contractors and vendors for time extensions. Mitigating this risk will depend on key risk management practices: careful analysis to identify the risk, assessment of the potential impact, and a timely response to manage the risk.

<strong>Analysis:</strong> We recommend conducting a schedule workshop that will comprise of all the project participants, including key stakeholders, to define the short-term goals of the project. Later, it is essential to identify activities that are necessary to achieve those goals and determine if they may be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts could include material delay, lack of labor forces, manufacturing closure, or delay in permitting.

This process will help the owner decide if a response plan is needed to mitigate the delay and under what circumstances the owner will merit additional time and cost to the project. In more severe cases, this pandemic may significantly impact markets where the need for the project is either no longer there or is significantly changed from its original business model and design. In this case, owners may need to suspend work.

<strong>Assess</strong><strong>:</strong> Owners need to make sure that contractors are taking reasonable measures to mitigate any delays arising as a result of COVID-19. However, there are many variables in this pandemic that are not under the control of any parties. That means owners should request a response plan from the contractor that would address mitigation strategies. An owner should compare the response plan with the pre-COVID-19 schedule to make a go / no-go decision. Undoubtedly, there would be an increase in the cost of the project if the owner decides to accelerate or compress the schedule. Therefore, an owner needs to perform a risk / benefit analysis to assess the impact of time and money on the project. Our next installment of this series will dig into the cost side further.

<strong>Manage / Resolve</strong><strong>:</strong> Finally, the owner should promptly document the progress of the project and identify the variation in the pre- and post-COVID-19 effects on the schedule. The owner should consider a virtual Pull Planning Session to encourage interaction with stakeholders and the contractor. Continuous monitoring and communication will keep all the parties on the same page and act as a catalyst for decision making at a higher level.

Stay tuned as we bring you the next pieces of this series.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you have been following along with our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/coping-with-covid-19-in-the-construction-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coping with COVID-19 in the Construction Industry series</a>, you will know that one of the first areas to see impacts from this crisis is cost. In this next installment of our series, we dive into some frequently asked questions related to cost impacts as a result of the coronavirus, along with answers drawn from our own experience and from talking with industry colleagues.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Has MGAC seen a spike in construction costs and supply issues? </strong>

The simple answer is no regarding material costs, but it is too early to assess the potential impacts on labor as construction jobs continue to be lost. For now, MGAC has seen no significant material increases, in fact, we anticipate a reduction in material costs in the coming months as global expansion reduces around the world. Already, we are seeing cost reductions with a surplus of steel and crude oil as demand slows. The IHS Materials Price Index (MPI) shows year-to-date prices down 18% and predicts production cuts could be on the horizon, particularly for aluminum, zinc, pulp, and rubber.

As owner’s representatives, we worry about the impact 6 to 12 months down the road, when hopefully our industry is closer to the status quo again. With the industry not fully recovered from the labor dip of the last recession, and with the recent job losses, a sudden increase in construction demand might ultimately lead to a significant increase in labor rates as demand far outweighs supply. Currently, the only impact to labor rates we have come across is the request for hazardous or danger pay due to COVID-19. In a similar vein, some workers, and not just site workers, have been paid extra or received additional benefits to work in 'hot zones' like New Orleans hit by natural disasters, while already dealing with the pandemic.

Many firms, including <a href="http://www.synergillc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synergi LLC</a>, a subcontractor for architectural metals and glass based in Maryland, have already become accustomed to disruptions in market supply, including the recent trade wars resulting in heavy tariffs on steel, aluminum, and glass. This has led to firms looking at other supply avenues in Asia or closer to home and moving their eggs from one basket to several to spread risk. On a few projects, we have heard of subcontractors struggling to get materials. Generally, this has been associated with equipment that may be assembled domestically, but requires small pieces from around the world, especially China. If you only have 90% of the materials to build a generator, you cannot deliver it to clients. The bigger issue arises if these materials are on the critical path forward, potentially pushing out the occupancy date.

<strong>How are general contractors on MGAC projects reacting to the crisis?  </strong>

To account for cost changes, it is important to first take note of what is changing on the ground. That, for the most part, starts with general contractors. So far, we have seen many different approaches—all with the purpose of promoting social distancing and cleanliness—but with many variations depending on the site location, construction phase, and state or local restrictions.

Speaking to owners and general contractors, it appears contractors have taken the onus to implement site safety measures, often with agreement from the owners. Primarily these have stemmed from CDC and OSHA guidelines, again with variations depending on the unique needs and circumstances of the project. On the sites we are currently working on, we have seen the following almost universal measures:
<ul>
 	<li>Social distancing measures for site workers between each other and others, such as delivery workers.</li>
 	<li>Additional communication through daily toolbox talks, letters, and onsite signage addressing workers on rights, precautionary advice, and best practices for safe work.</li>
 	<li>Infectious disease control planning.</li>
 	<li>Newly implemented work schedules, often with longer days, but fewer full days onsite.</li>
 	<li>Shift premiums relaxed.</li>
 	<li>Additional hand wash stations and use of sanitizers.</li>
 	<li>Employee check-in / health screening, sometimes involving temperature checks.</li>
 	<li>An increase in communication / education between general contractors and subcontractors.</li>
 	<li>Quarantining ill or potentially ill workers.</li>
 	<li>Increase in cleaning measures.</li>
 	<li>Implementation of masks and other PPE, often before State or City requirements.</li>
 	<li>Contact tracing on and offsite to help health workers.</li>
 	<li>Restrictions on tool sharing without decontamination.</li>
 	<li>Expanding lunch / rest areas.</li>
 	<li>Restrictions on who / how many can enter trailers.</li>
</ul>
Some measures that we have seen intermittently include additional supervision to monitor social distancing at places like stairwells, elevators, and gated entrances. Some sites have shutdown protocols for when a worker tests positive and, in rare cases, some are using decontamination trailers and negative pressure as precautionary measures.

These changes have had a positive impact on sites slowing down the virus spread, but they have led to some potential contract questions regarding liquidated damages and time extensions. Talking with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-englehart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Englehart</a> from <a href="https://www.clarkconstruction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark Construction</a>, his biggest worry, first and foremost, is employee health and safety. However, when asked about project durations, he agreed there could be a reduction in productivity and therefore a potential increase in project duration. That said, Clark Construction is doing everything to mitigate delays without sacrificing safety and staying within CDC guidelines, and frequently communicates with owners. In speaking to an anonymous contractor, the above measures are meant for everyone's safety, but there are fears the benchmark of 60% productivity during the day installing their particular trade could drop, especially while workers adjust to the new norm. For example, using PPE is essential on job sites, but it is not ordinarily used as widely as it is during this pandemic, which can cause a slowdown in work and communication. Some of the immediate issues MGAC is seeing onsite which may concern owners are:
<ul>
 	<li>Reduction in productivity for many reasons (adjusting to PPE, new teams, schedule changes, slowed deliveries).</li>
 	<li>Increase in contractors’ costs (additional cleaning, PPE, supervision, cost of signage, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Increase in accidents due to protective equipment difficulties.</li>
 	<li>Quarantining of certain subcontractors.</li>
 	<li>Temporary site shutdowns.</li>
 	<li>Potential legal issues as a result of shutdown avoidance despite guideline recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Who will pay for these additional precautions taking place?  </strong>

There is no question COVID-19 is going to cost projects money—the question is “what is a legitimate expense and who will pay for it?” Broadly speaking, this can be broken down into two groups. First, there will be the physical cost, such as PPE, disposal services, cleaning tools / services, wash stations, and more. These are the things you can immediately see. Second, will be the potential extension in time due to a reduction in productivity, slow supply chain, and temporary site closings—the things you do not physically see. These are more difficult to address, and payment responsibility will depend on your contract and where the project stood before the coronavirus impacted the project.

<a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910SubpartI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to OSHA Section 19.10</a>, employers are responsible for employee protective equipment, whether that be headgear, protective glasses, or face masks. Although the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSHA Act of 1970</a> does not specifically address airborne diseases, there is a "<a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/section5-duties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Duties Clause</a>," which simply says employers "shall furnish to each of his employee’s employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees." Additionally, OSHA <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/publications/publication.athruz?pType=Industry&amp;pID=651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently released guidelines</a> to prepare workplaces in the face of COVID-19, and although not legally binding, these guidelines reinforce the employer’s responsibility for providing a safe work environment.

In regard to extensions of time, this will undoubtedly unravel over the next year or so with potential change orders, probable court disputes, and new legal regulations from government agencies. This portion of the question will be addressed in more detail next in our series, but our first recommendation to owners is to establish where the project was cost- and schedule-wise before the impact of COVID-19 to make sure there was a line in the sand agreed upon by all parties. Who pays for these extensions of time will depend on the type of contract, the detail in clauses for additional time, and the relationship with the owner. Whether a pandemic or epidemic is or is not listed in the contract does not really matter, because most all construction contracts contain a clause that affords relief in circumstances outside of the contractor’s control or arising from unforeseen conditions or circumstances. Such clauses entitle the contractor to additional time, and potentially, compensation providing they can prove it. No doubt many large general contractors have been taking daily logs specific to the impact of COVID-19, and diving into schedules to make regular annotations. We recommend owners do the same to have the means to defend themselves in the future, if needed, and to offer transparency in these unprecedented times.

Much more to come on this topic and more in our next two installments of the series, including:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last few weeks, we have been sharing updates through our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/coping-with-covid-19-in-the-construction-industry/">Coping with COVID-19 in the Construction Industry</a> series, doing our best to help you understand how COVID-19 is affecting the commercial construction industry, as well as how our COVID-19 Task Force expects the industry to shift and change as a result.

<a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/coping-with-covid-19-part-iii-impacts-on-cost/">In our last post</a>, we focused on the cost impacts of COVID-19. Today, we will be talking about contracts, as well as addressing some common questions on how contracts may be affected moving forward.

<strong>A subcontractor has walked off the job due to fears of COVID-19. As an owner, what are my options?</strong>

This has occurred on some projects that MGAC is involved in—deemed essential by the State—and in one case, without prompt notice. This leaves the general contractor in a tricky position with a contractual performance obligation, assuming all CDC and OHSA health measures are in place. For the subcontractor, it was understandably a difficult decision, as they were primarily concerned for the safety of their employees in a rapidly changing situation. However, for the owner, there are some safeguards. The contract is between the subcontractor and general contractor. An owner can assume that the general contractor's contract with the subcontractor is going to work similarly to their own contract with the contractor; there will be performance requirements tied to an agreed-upon project schedule and staffing requirements to make that possible. Likewise, there is a termination option for the subcontractor’s non-performance. If the general contractor has the appropriate insurances, this should cover additional procurement costs and liquidated damages.

So far, MGAC’s recommendation has been to increase communication and ensure the general contractor updates the owner on a regular basis on the subcontractor’s voluntary suspension of work. By working as a collaborative team with the general contractor and subcontractor to satisfy onsite safety, you will ensure the delay is temporary and should be able to complete the project as close to on-schedule as possible. However, if the subcontractor’s self-imposed absence rises to a certain level that it presents a serious problem for the project and substitute contractors are unavailable, the owner and general contractor will likely have a discussion regarding potential legal ramifications.

<strong>A public authority has announced a state of emergency. What does this mean for my contract?</strong>

Largely speaking, this is one of the simpler questions. If the public authority having jurisdiction forcibly closes the site, then the contractor may stop work and potentially time and cost would be recoverable by the contractor if proven. That said, many contracts have clauses for allowing a contractor to terminate if a project is stopped for longer than 60 to 120 days, so owners may find themselves essentially needing to start again depending on the timeframe at hand.

<strong>Do I need to provide a future clause about pandemics?</strong>

Despite COVID-19, many projects are still moving forward, and contracts are getting signed now and will be 12 months from now, so what should owners look for in future contract negotiations?

You do not need to be a lawyer to understand that using boilerplate contracts containing a paragraph about force majeure with very limited specifics is not going to cut it moving forward. It may be sufficient dragging through a court of law, but this is a risk—and often, courts refuse to excuse performance unless the contingency is specifically listed. MGAC is advising owners to review and amend future contracts not only for pandemic verbiage, but also for other potential events (listed below). As part of this process, MGAC would also recommend assigning risk, schedule, and cost responsibilities to these events. No contract can adequately anticipate every possible event, but a pandemic, along with the additional events below, are now ones that will and should be explicitly included moving forward.

<strong>Below is a list of events to be included in 2020 and future contracts from the <a href="https://iccwbo.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/icc-forcemajeure-hardship-clauses-march2020.pdf">International Chamber of Commerce</a>:</strong><strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Plague, epidemic, pandemic, outbreaks of infectious disease, or any other public health crisis, including quarantine or other employee restrictions;</li>
 	<li>War (whether declared or not);</li>
 	<li>Armed conflict (including, but not limited to hostile attack, blockade, military embargo);</li>
 	<li>Invasion;</li>
 	<li>Act of a foreign enemy;</li>
 	<li>Extensive military mobilization;</li>
 	<li>Civil war;</li>
 	<li>Riot, rebellion, revolution, military or usurped power, insurrection;</li>
 	<li>Civil commotion or disorder;</li>
 	<li>Mob violence;</li>
 	<li>Act of civil disobedience;</li>
 	<li>Act of terrorism;</li>
 	<li>Sabotage or piracy;</li>
 	<li>Act of authority, whether lawful or unlawful;</li>
 	<li>Compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation, or direction;</li>
 	<li>Curfew restriction;</li>
 	<li>Expropriation or compulsory acquisition, requisition;</li>
 	<li>Seizure of works;</li>
 	<li>Nationalization;</li>
 	<li>Act of God;</li>
 	<li>Natural disaster, such as, but not limited to violent storm, cyclone, typhoon, hurricane, tornado, blizzard, earthquake, volcanic activity, landslide, tidal wave, tsunami, flood, damage or destruction by lightning, drought, explosion, and fire;</li>
 	<li>Destruction of machines, equipment, factories;</li>
 	<li>Prolonged breakdown of transport;</li>
 	<li>Prolonged disconnect of telecommunication or electric current;</li>
 	<li>General labor disturbance, such as, but not limited to boycott, strike and lock-out, go-slow, occupation of factories, and premises; and</li>
 	<li>Shortage or inability to obtain critical material or supplies to the extent not subject to the reasonable control of the subject Party.</li>
</ul>
On our next and final installment of this series, we will discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on future planning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the final installment of our Coping with COVID-19 in the Construction Industry series, where our COVID-19 Task Force has answered questions and provided direction on all things COVID-related. If you missed our previous posts, we recommend you first verse yourself in the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/coping-with-covid-19-in-the-construction-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I: Introduction + Impacts on Health &amp; Wellness</a></strong></li>

</ul>
Now that we understand how to navigate the impacts of COVID-19 across the full spectrum of a construction project, our final topic revolves around discussing the impacts of COVID-19 on future planning, namely:

<strong>What do owners need to think about as they prepare workspaces for returning staff?</strong>

While planning and preparing facilities for staff returning to work, owners need to consider the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Implementing features for easier “social separation” in the workplace, as well as reducing workstation density by <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/health/coronavirus-office-makeover.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200504&amp;instance_id=18219&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=61997754&amp;segment_id=26609&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=3099c8d2055eefe443452f852eabfc46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revisiting open-plan layouts</a></strong>;</li>
 	<li>Broadening remote work capabilities and strengthening remote work policies for optimal productivity;</li>
 	<li>Increasing facility cleaning protocols;</li>
 	<li>Pursuing certifications for healthy buildings (i.e. WELL Building Standard, FitWel Standard, etc.);</li>
 	<li>Incorporating new materials with antimicrobial surfaces;</li>
 	<li>Increasing emphasis on employee health and wellbeing;</li>
 	<li>Improving infrastructure to support extended telework; and</li>
 	<li>Expanding emergency operations plans.</li>
</ul>
It is also important to remember that the reality of COVID-19 is changing daily, and there may be additional future impacts that still remain unknown. This means we must all do our part to stay vigilant and ready to respond to these unknowns. We must be proactive in our communications efforts and lean on our colleagues for information-sharing. Above all, we must continue to prioritize the health of our teams on the ground.

We hope this series has been both educational and informative, and we thank you for learning alongside us as we navigate this new normal together.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Thanks for taking the time to speak with us today! Let’s start with you walking us through your role at MGAC.

<b>Nate Larmore: </b>Sure. I work in our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/technology-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technology Solutions</a> group advising clients on all things technology-related, mostly in healthcare. Our clients rely on dozens of systems, and typically, there's not a lot of continuity in how these technologies are planned, procured, deployed, and operated. Some get managed by one department, some by vendors, with others by another department or third party. There tends to be a lot of confusion and surprise costs until our team comes in. We bring order and predictability to that chaos.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What project is taking up most of your time right now?

<b>NL: </b>It’s a balance between several healthcare clients—a large hospital tower in Seattle, a complex ambulatory tower just outside of New York City, and a hospital replacement campus in rural Washington State.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Do you typically do a lot of traveling back-and-forth, pre-COVID?

<b>NL:</b> In normal circumstances, I usually travel several times a month—but of course, we’ve all been grounded, so to speak, since the “shelter in place” orders. Fortunately, we’ve got excellent remote meeting tools here at MGAC, so the projects haven’t missed a beat.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What brought you to MGAC? What were you doing before you joined our team?

<b>NL: </b>I started out in IT. I evolved into what the industry calls an enterprise architect—engineering how to organize the hundreds of systems so the right data gets to the right place at the right time. Over time, I became an owner’s representative for all a project’s technology systems. I was introduced to MGAC after an old friend came on board and told me about his new role and the Technology Solutions group. The culture, clients, and leadership seemed like it could be a great fit. Even more specifically, the blend of high-performance teams and entrepreneurial spirit that had been cultivated in Technology Solutions sounded really exciting. I was able to join MGAC last Fall.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So, growing up, did you have any kind of inkling that you would be doing what you do now?

<b>NL:</b> Oh, no, not at all! I enjoy what I do, but if I could do it all over again, I’d have been a pro surfer.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s different!

<b>NL: </b>Saltwater is in my veins and the great outdoors is the only place that always makes sense! I grew up on the gorgeous island of Guam. Guam’s a U.S. territory east of the Philippines and south of Japan. My parents and sister still live out there, as a matter of fact. Wearing a suit and tie into the C-suite is great, but board shorts are better! I guess fighter pilot might have been on the list too. After seeing <i>Top Gun </i>as a kid I thought: “<i>That’s what I’ve got to be, I have got to be Maverick.” </i>But time flies, college comes along, then one thing led to another. After finishing undergrad, I got into technology and it’s taken off from there. My mom’s an artist, my dad’s a theologian, and somehow, I ended up an engineer. Who knew?<b></b>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So, that’s a good segue into my next question… How’s the surfing in the Pacific Northwest? Does it even exist?

<b>NL:</b> Ha! Not good. More the point, it’s non-existent. I haven’t lived in the islands for decades, but growing up there, you never get over it and there’s always an urge to go back.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>I understand that. What’s your favorite on-the-job story or memory?

<b>NL: </b>I think the best part of this job, aside from the fun of solving problems—is there are certain people that you really enjoy working with. What's kind of unique about this business is it really doesn’t matter where you live, because the work takes us all over the country and overseas too. That dynamic brings interesting people together into some unusual circumstances. There are so many hysterical stories “from the old days” that some of us still talk about when we get together. And these crazy experiences happened all over the world. Somebody will ask, “<i>Remember that project manager that looked and sounded exactly like Morty Seinfeld, Jerry’s dad?” </i>Somebody else will start quoting hilarious one-liners from an old coworker. <i>Or “that crazy time when that plane skidded down the runway in Pohnpei and we were all stranded for weeks…”</i> The people and experiences keep it interesting.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What do you find to be the most challenging aspect of your job?

<b>NL: </b>I really enjoy focusing on something for long periods of time and solving it, but sometimes in this business, that's hard to do. The phone is always ringing; meetings are always popping up. I think that's part and parcel of the unique work we’re doing—we are bringing order to chaos, and there are times when that chaos jumps in and rattles our orderly world.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>How do you think the work you do is making an impact in your community?

<b>NL:</b> I’m blessed because most of my work is healthcare-oriented. The work we’re doing serving healthcare clients allows them to better serve their community. Because I’m a dad, the work can really tug at my heartstrings. The work in pediatric environments can be emotional. I’m very blessed that our three kids are in good health, but not every family has that particular advantage. There are many families with children who are going through unbelievably difficult circumstances. So there are times when I’m walking through a children’s hospital or pediatric unit, shadowing caregivers or developing analysis data, that the work becomes intensely personal. It gets emotional when you look past the buildings and the systems, and you see the people who rely on the work we’re doing. It’s very moving. Seeing how our work impacts those in need is a huge motivator to keep striving and help our clients deliver the very best healthcare possible.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>I imagine that can be very inspiring. What else inspires you about the work?

<b>NL: </b>It’s also fun to share the work with my family. Once while driving from Seattle to San Diego for a family trip, the kids were amazed at how many times I would point to one landmark after another: <i>“Oh, there’s a hospital I worked on, there’s a project I worked on,”</i> city after city. Even now that they're a little older, they’ll still point out different buildings as “dad’s project.”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So, is that what ultimately gives you energy?

<b>NL:</b> Depends on the day, right? But the daily source, and not to get too metaphysical, of my energy and inspiration experience is my faith. I’ve been put here for a reason. I have a purpose. I wake up every morning thinking,<i>“What can I do to fulfill God’s purposes for me?”</i>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What about the secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<b>NL: </b>Well, we’ve got three kids and they clear the mechanism right away. They’re great kids—I bet every parent says that, right? I’m a remote worker, so as soon as I leave my office and walk up the stairs to where everybody else is, it’s an instant shift from work to MarioKart and corny dad jokes.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s a great point. You’ve been doing this for a while now—working remote—and now, all of a sudden, the whole country is finding themselves in that same remote work situation. Do you have any advice for people who may be reading this to help them achieve a work-life balance?

<b>NL: </b>I can’t claim to have it completely figured out, because it’s a process like everything else. I’ve been working full-time remote for the better part of the last ten years, and prior to that, partly remote for several years. But the greatest challenge I’ve had, and I think most remote workers have, is keeping a healthy work-life balance. You have to develop the right mentality to work full-time from home. But I think the challenge is: if you <i>do </i>have the right personality, it’s really hard to turn it off.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That makes sense.

<b>NL:</b> When you enjoy what you do, it feels like a hobby. My wife and kids will pleasantly remind me sometimes: <i>“Dad, it’s the weekend.” </i>And I’m like, <i>“You’re right, you’re right.” </i>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>I think we’re all guilty of letting our work creep into our free time on occasion.

<b>NL:</b> It’s easy to do, because you’re thinking about it all the time. But the owner of our company, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, speaks to the whole company via Zoom at least once a week, and he’s done a good job of emphasizing this point: make sure to really unplug and take care of yourself. We’ve got to take care of our clients, take care of our company, and take care of ourselves too.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>I love that.

<b>NL:</b> It really helps to have a dedicated space in your home that’s committed to work. Since I’ve been remote working so long, that work space is fundamental criteria when we’re shopping for a home. An office with a door that closes. As we’re talking right now, I’m sitting at my desk in my office with a particular place for everything. It’s similar to being at an office, I suppose. Having a dedicated space like that is really helpful.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That does make a big difference.

<b>NL: </b>During this time when we all feel cooped up, we all need to remember to take some time, whether it's before work or during the day, to get up and move around. Step outside and get some fresh air, maybe just take a walk around the block. Give yourself a mental break and give your body a break by moving around. Take a little lunch break. If you can, it’s nice to go into another room, even if it's just for 10-15 minutes. Just get up from your desk now and then. If you’re not intentional, hours will pass and you’ve been glued to your laptop and phone. Move around, your body will be grateful.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s all very timely advice, considering what everyone is going through right now. Next, I want to move into some rapid-fire questions, so try to answer with the first thing that comes to mind. Sounds good?

<b>NL: </b>Sounds dangerous. Now I’m nervous.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Name a book that changed your life.

<b>NL: </b>The Bible is the first thing that comes to mind. I read it every day.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>How about a favorite quote that inspires you?

<b>NL: </b><em>“What do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?”</em> That keeps everything in the right perspective.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Describe your job in five words or less.

<b>NL:</b> I’m gonna’ have to finger-count this to make sure I’m not going over five words... 2, 3, 4, 5. That fits! “We bring order to chaos.”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>This may be a little different for you, since you work from home, but what’s your go-to lunch order?

<b>NL: </b>Pre-COVID is a more interesting answer, because here in COVID times, we eat at home constantly. But there is a sandwich joint owned by a local guy nearby, and I tend to go there and get the chipotle cheddar sandwich on a jalapeño bun. You couldn’t do that every day, but that and some Rolaids, to me, is the perfect lunch.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What’s the weirdest thing we may find in your desk or work bag?

<b>NL: </b>At this moment, the desk is very tidy and clean. But I can tell you the weirdest thing I’ve <i>ever</i> carried in my work bag.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Let’s hear it.

<b>NL:</b> Being an ex-IT guy, and a lot of my coworkers being IT guys, let’s just say we’re not exactly slaves to fashion. At one point I worked with a guy—brilliant, brilliant technical guy with no fashion sense. We had to regularly tell him to dress-up for client meetings. Wear a button-down, put on a jacket, etc. After a while, I bought him and carried around in my bag a clip-on tie for him to use. I’d have it waiting when we’d meet in the lobby to go to meetings.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Ha! You’re a good coworker.

<b>NL:</b> We just <i>knew </i>he would never bring a tie. He’d always forget. So, I found a nice, neutral color that I knew would always match whatever he happened to be wearing. It had to be a clip-on, too, because I wasn’t sure he knew how to tie it. And I wasn’t gonna tie it for him.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What is the first thing you do at work every day?

<b>NL: </b>Probably look at emails, and that’s because I work with east coast people, so I wake up thinking, <i>“Oh man, they’ve been at it for hours. What’s waiting in my inbox?”</i>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What about the last thing?

<b>NL: </b>This may seem kinda’ lame, but right now, as I look at my desk, I’ve got dual monitors and my laptop monitor—and actually, this might be another tip for people who are working from home. But I always put the same things in the same places on the display monitors. Email and calendar are always on the same monitor. Production things are always on the left, anything related to the web is always on the right. I know that’s goofy, but for me, everything is in its place, even digitally.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So organized!

<b>NL:</b> Yeah, but at the end of the day—and I’ve actually never even realized this before, until you asked it—I always clear the desk, which means close out all the windows. If there’s anything outstanding, make sure it gets done. And then close out everything. It gives you a sense of completion. There are no screens open anymore, and all I see is my desktop background, which is a picture at Yosemite. It’s a nice way of closing out the mechanism. The work for the day is done, and what’s left on screen is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It’s the great outdoors, the splendor of creation, the one place where everything always makes sense.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC is excited to announce the hire of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniecramerpmp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie Cramer</a>, our new Vice President of Talent Acquisition Management. In this role, Stephanie will be formalizing MGAC’s recruiting process and strategy around how to build tomorrow’s team, as well as working on career progression development for our existing employees.

Stephanie comes to MGAC with over 15 years of experience across talent acquisition, human resources, operations, and project management. She built her career in the technology sector and is eager to start working now in the A/E/C industry.

“I feel the timing of my joining MGAC is uncanny. I have spent many years focused on talent acquisition and materializing leadership plans into action around Human Resources, specifically, recruiting has been a passion of mine.” Stephanie says. “These past few weeks have been like no others. They have drawn the world’s attention to the inequity of our society. For us, they have caused us to pause and take an honest look into the fabric of our teams, corporate culture, and our daily actions. I am excited to incorporate principles of the Black Lives Matter movement into the DNA of our Human Resources strategy. I’m determined to embrace our voices.”

Stephanie firmly believes that talent acquisition is a psychology-based career, and that success is found not in matching resumes with job descriptions, but in being able to connect with people, understand culture, and match accordingly.

“MGAC’s talented staff is our company’s reason for being, as well as our path to success, and we are so excited to welcome Stephanie to our team,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, Founder and President of MGAC. “Stephanie’s approach is focused around consultative listening, finding the right talent, and developing the careers and skills of our existing employees.”

Stephanie was born on a farm in Missouri, though she has spent the last 15 years in Washington DC. She currently lives on Capitol Hill with her husband and their two children.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.

Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meaganbroyles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meagan Broyles</a>, Human Resources Manager at MGAC.

---

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Welcome to the Impact series! Let’s start with you telling us a bit about your role.

<strong>Meagan Broyles:</strong> I’m the Human Resources Manager here at MGAC. My responsibilities cover all areas, from employee relations, benefits, compliance and reporting, payroll, onboarding and offboarding employees, to background checks, immigration processes, and career development.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. What kind of challenges have you been facing due to COVID-19? From an HR perspective, what have these last three months looked like for you?

<strong>MB:</strong> I think we’ve been pretty lucky that a lot of our employees were already setup with capabilities to continue working and supporting our clients remotely. It certainly is an adjustment for it to be an everyday occurrence, but we’ve used this time to become more efficient in our processes and communication, and to come together as a company. Mark Anderson hosts weekly MGAC Squawk Boxes where he shares important news, updates, and business impacts of COVID-19. We’ve also been sending “Sharing and Caring” e-mails, where employees are able to submit fun photos, stories, recipes, or other things they’re doing. So, while it's a challenging time, it has really brought us together and has expanded, reengaged, and enhanced our culture.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Tell me a little bit about what led you to MGAC and this role.

<strong>MB:</strong> So, this October will be nine years at MGAC.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Wow!

<strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, long time! I was provided the job description for a Project Coordinator role, by a family member who works at the firm, while I began my job search after college. I applied, landed an interview, and was hired, all without ever telling my family member that I had even applied… I still get some grief for that! I began my MGAC career in Marketing, where I spent several years before moving into an Education and Professional Development position. When the HR Director at the time left the firm, I assumed some of those duties and I ended up enjoying it so much, that I moved into an HR Generalist position, and then the HR Manager role.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> So, it sounds like you kind of stumbled into the HR space. What is it about this work that made you realize it was where you were meant to be?

<strong>MB:</strong> Yes, I did! I went to school for Tourism and Events Management. I also studied business, and decided (not so quickly) that I liked it more than the events, although I do keep that experience in my back pocket. I’m constantly awarded the opportunity to expand my skills and capabilities to help others, which is something I value deeply—and how I knew I landed in the right space.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Do you have any favorite on-the-job stories or memories? Any anecdote that explains why you love your job so much?

<strong>MB:</strong> My fondest memories have been the times that I am able to get to know our employees on a personal level, whether that be at a company happy hour, holiday party, summer event, or even sharing what they did over the weekend. When we can break down barriers and build relationships, the real opportunities to support their growth comes to life.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What would you say the most challenging aspect of your job is?

<strong>MB:</strong> It’s the unknown. Anything can happen when it comes to people, so you really have to be flexible, which can be a challenge for my sometimes type A personality. You have to learn how to navigate in the grey areas. That has been one of the biggest challenges, but also the biggest area of growth.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What kind of lasting impact do you hope to make both at MGAC and in your community in general?

<strong>MB:</strong> It is always going to be about whether I can add value. Did I make someone's day better or easier? Did I help someone get through a challenge they were having? Did I create or improve programs? Did I help contribute to the overall growth, mission, and values of the company or community? If I can say yes to those types of things then that is not only rewarding, but I have succeeded in accomplishing my goals.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What gives you energy? From a work perspective or a personal perspective, what energizes you each morning?

<strong>MB:</strong> Can I answer for both?

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Absolutely.

<strong>MB:</strong> From a work standpoint, what gives me energy is being around positive, collaborative people. I enjoy working with employees who are enthusiastic to team up and move things forward through different viewpoints. But what actually gets me out of bed in the morning is my dog scratching at me to take him outside.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> I can relate to that one.

<strong>MB:</strong> Recently, he’s been scratching at me and acting like he needs to go out, but then when I get up, he just gets in my warm spot and refuses to leave.<strong> </strong>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Smart dog. What about your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>MB:</strong> That’s another two-part answer. I first use my car ride home to de-stress and take my mind off of work. Then when I come home, I take my dog for a long walk. But, if I find that I can’t turn my brain off, since I’m constantly running through my to-do list for the next day, I listen to podcasts, music, or something to clear the clutter and just enjoy the scenery.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Any good podcast recommendations?

<strong>MB:</strong> I try to switch it up. Sometimes I go for a Reality TV personality hosted podcast or a crime-related podcast. Or sometimes, it’s daily news. There are so many people branching out into the world of podcasts right now that I don’t like to limit myself to just one genre.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How about favorite books? Any books that have changed your life or outlook on life?

<strong>MB:</strong> I don’t think I can honestly say that a book has changed my life, because I mostly read thrillers or murder mysteries, so that would be a little strange.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Ha! That’s fair. What about a quote that inspires you?

<strong>MB:</strong> It might have to be “Bloom where you’re planted.” I think the first time that really resonated with me was during my high school graduation. It was a part of our commencement speech, and it really applies to not only my career trajectory and evolving roles within MGAC, but also reminds me to really dig in deep with whatever opportunity comes my way and to make the best out of every situation.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Awesome. Let’s move into some rapid-fire questions, so feel free to answer these with whatever first comes to mind.

<strong>MB:</strong> Sounds good.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>MB:</strong> Hmm, my job. Maybe, “always stay on your toes?”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s the first thing you do when you get to work every day?

<strong>MB:</strong> Get a cup of coffee and dive right into e-mails / to-do lists.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What about the last thing?

<strong>MB:</strong> Saying a round of goodbyes to everybody on my floor, if people are still there. What I’ve learned over the past few years is that it really makes a difference in your day saying good morning and goodnight to somebody. You feel a sense of belonging, and I like to make sure employees know that we care about them even by simply wishing them a good night.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> I love that. What is the strangest thing we may find in your work bag or desk?

<strong>MB:</strong> Hmm. I can’t even say construction boots, because that’s so typical for our industry.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> I actually haven’t heard that one yet!

<strong>MB: </strong>Okay, well then construction boots! People may think that's odd for me to have in HR, but I like taking advantage of any opportunity when a PM stops by my office and says, “Hey, do you want to go see this project?”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What can’t you leave your home without? What’s always in your purse or pocket?

<strong>MB:</strong> It’s really sad, but my cell phone.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What about your go-to lunch order?

<strong>MB:</strong> I typically bring my lunch, but if I were to step out from the office, I’d likely go and get a salad or bowl from Chop’t.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What’s your biggest goal for 2020?

<strong>MB: </strong>I am currently studying to earn the Society for Human Resource Management Certified Professional (SHRM-CP) credential. It will be rewarding to bring even more knowledge, skills, and capabilities to the firm and our employees in support of our overall mission and goals.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCIPTION</em>

<em>Hi. I'm Marcus Hurley. I'm a senior project manager at MGAC, and today, we're gonna take a look at the American University Hall of Science. Let's get moving!</em>

<em>All the stormwater for this system will go under this rain garden. This is gonna be an area where students congregate. Right now, I'm currently standing about 8 to 10 feet below grade. You can see the clerestory windows. But it really acts and functions like a space of any other, in that it's not cut off from light.</em>

<em>As you can see, we have all kinds of hydronic pipes, electrical, low voltage, gases. If this is a science building, why not show them? Our emergency chiller, that's part of our critical systems. But what's really interesting about this, it's actually a building within a building. A fully enclosed air hammer came out from the factory in Ohio with all the cladding attached. It was just dropped in by crane, and then built the penthouse around it. </em>

<em>Well, I hope you've enjoyed seeing what's happening at the American University Hall of Science. Continue to follow us and see MGAC's next move.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandey-rodgers-mcdonald-b3b83a8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandey McDonald</a>, Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">---</span>

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Welcome to the Impact blog! Let’s start with describing your role at MGAC.

<strong>Brandey McDonald:</strong> I am a Project Manager, who works in the public sector with the DC Department of General Services (DGS), one of our newer clients with MGAC. I have been working with DGS now for over two and a half years.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What led you to this role, and to MGAC?

<strong>BM:</strong> I’m going be really honest. While working at DGS with a competitor of MGAC's, a colleague from the MGAC team, said to me one day, “Brandey, I think you would be a good fit at MGAC. If you ever feel the need to move, you should really consider it.” And, I simply said, “Oh! Okay. Thanks. That's nice.” A Vice President at MGAC stepped in and really turned it up a bit. He reached out to me and said, “We’d really like to have you on the team. We’ve heard so many good things about you. And, we really think you would fit the culture. What could we possibly do to get you over here?”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Oh wow. So, you were being recruited!

<strong>BM:</strong> Yes! That went on for several months. But, what really solidified the deal for me, was one day at a DGS happy hour that same Vice President and I had the chance to talk personally. He mentioned to me that he had just attended a concert at the Anthem, a popular music venue in DC. At that point, I thought to myself, “Well, the only concert I know of that happened there recently was Wu-Tang Clan. And, I know he didn’t go to see Wu-Tang Clan.” But, it turns out that it was the case! And, he was a huge hip-hop fan like me.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> So, in the end, that’s what sealed the deal!

<strong>BM:</strong> That’s exactly what sealed the deal for me! We started talking about hip-hop and how he grew up in Brooklyn. We realized that we had so many things in common and just really hit it off. So, that’s what truly solidified the deal for me with MGAC. And, I’ve been so happy ever since.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> I love that story. So, it sounds like it’s really the people that drew you to MGAC? Of course, the work is exciting, but you ultimately made your decision because of the people.

<strong>BM:</strong> Yes, that’s correct. The work wasn’t that important. It was the people! My first day at MGAC was the beginning of the annual meeting in December. After meeting the rest of the team, I went home and thought, “I have found the company that I want to retire with.” The corporate culture exhibited during the annual meeting was so wonderful. And, I was very impressed with everyone in the room. Every single one of them.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. What kind of projects are taking up most of your time right now?

<strong>BM:</strong> I’m currently working on Eliot-Hine Middle School, which is actually taking up every ounce of my time at DGS. It’s a 143,000 SF 4-phase delivery school modernization and renovation project in the District of Columbia. It’s expected to house 400 students. Phase 1, which is the main portion of the building, is delivering on August 22nd.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What kind of impact do you think this kind of work has on your community? Working on a middle school, it may seem obvious, but I’d like to hear your thoughts on that.

<strong>BM:</strong> Overall, the thing about working in the public sector is it simply is rewarding. But, schools, in particular, are very rewarding! And, Eliot-Hine was a school that needed a lot of love. They only had one window, which they called “the weather window,” because that was the only way the staff and students could check the weather once they were inside. And, as we work towards completion, one can walk throughout the corridors and see so much light coming in. That is inspiring knowing that more light will motivate the children of Eliot-Hine. The students will not only have a brand-new school, but the staff will have a brand-new space to teach in. It’s a new space that will create more pride for both the children and staff. So, we, the DGS team, and the community, are really excited about it.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s amazing. What did you want to do when you were growing up? Is this how you wanted to spend your life, or has this career track been a surprise?

<strong>BM:</strong> Well, I originally thought that I wanted to be an architect. I have always been a lover of art. In high school, I was a very good art student. When I started my undergraduate studies, I started out majoring in architectural engineering. But, I eventually changed my major because I truly was not a fan of wearing construction boots. Go figure! So, I changed my major to social sciences to attend law school and become a municipal judge someday. I watched a lot of LA Law as a child. After graduation, an employer had me take a career assessment test where the results indicated I should really rethink that law school thing and focus on a career in finance.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Wow, all over the place.

<strong>BM:</strong> Right! Like so many when graduating from college! So, I initially started my career in finance as a banker. Then, I moved to institutional finance in municipal investment banking being a part of a team that financed municipal projects like I manage today. I obtained my Master's in Finance and Real Estate while moving up in my career and became a commercial real estate lender until the market downfall in the industry. I transitioned to the construction industry in 2009 when I sparked the interest of an executive from Clark Construction who had an interest in helping minority women with strong business acumen become entrepreneurs in the construction industry. I founded and ran my own elevator contracting firm from 2009 to 2016, specializing in public projects. I left the elevator industry when I discovered my previous employer was managing a number of new elevator installation projects in schools for the DC Department of General Services. It was the perfect match!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What a journey!

<strong>BM:</strong> It has definitely been a journey.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What would be your favorite on-the-job memory or story?

<strong>BM: </strong>There are so very many. One that really sticks out, is the day that I got the call to take the Eliot-Hine project. I had always been one who was very content managing small capital projects. But, one morning, these e-mails pertaining to Eliot-Hine just showed up my inbox. They were e-mails from the previous project manager’s inbox. I kept thinking, “What is going on? And, why am I getting all her e-mails?’ My Vice President called me and greeted me with, ‘Heyyyy.’ And, I mimicked him with a, “Uh, nooooo.” We shared a laugh because we all knew Eliot-Hine was going to be one of the most difficult projects in the DGS portfolio.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What would you say the most challenging aspect of your job has been? Either this project specifically, or just your job in general?

<strong>BM:</strong> Maintaining rock-solid relationships and keeping everyone on the project at bay. As the owner’s representative, it is not only my job to represent the owner, but it is truly my job to lead the entire team, making sure this project is delivered on time and on budget. So, I would have to say that one of the most challenging things about this job is making sure I wake up every day and come in to work with a smile on my face, while managing all the different personalities on my team. I’ll also add that being a woman in this industry is challenging when there are a lot of men who approach things in a more aggressive fashion. So, the challenge is making sure everyone is working in tandem so we can continue to deliver the best possible project.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Have you learned anything new while working on this project?

<strong>BM:</strong> Overall, I have learned what it takes to manage a project of this caliber. While I, again, have managed small capital projects in the past, the amount of knowledge one learns on small capital projects does not compare to the wealth of knowledge one learns on a $100M project.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What do you find to be the most rewarding part of your job?

<strong>BM:</strong> The most rewarding part of my job is when the project is complete, and the client is happy. In the past, when I have been a part of projects where a school has received a new elevator, there were handicapped children who were so happy to see someone thought enough of them. That and the smile on the administrative and teaching staff’s face is always so rewarding. I cannot wait to deliver this project because I can see the excitement in the faces of the administrative staff when we walk the site together. They also tell me how thankful and appreciative they are of the work I do. Now, that is rewarding!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What gives you energy? What’s your reason for getting up in the morning?

<strong>BM:</strong> What motivates me more than anything is making an impact on others. Again, going back to being a woman in this business where you just do not see a lot of women who look like me is something that motivates me every day. I say to myself every day ‘Go get it, girl.’ So, I take the influence and the impact that I can have on others who want to follow in my footsteps very seriously. I work to show them that they can get here someday, as well.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> As a minority woman, I imagine you’ve had to break down a lot of barriers to get to where you are today. What kind of advice would you have for someone who may want to follow in your footsteps, but doesn’t know how to get there? Or even where to start?

<strong>BM:</strong> I would say: keep your head on straight, don't become too emotional. As a female, in general, remember that this is a male-dominated business. And, while it is okay to show some emotion, because you are a female, just make sure that you do not show too much emotion. Think things through from a strategic perspective, a logical perspective, and never allow your emotions to drive your decisions. I would also say to always maintain your confidence. In this business, a woman cannot afford to lack confidence. When you are leading this many people, whether you are walking on site or leading a meeting, make sure you hold your head high.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s wonderful. What about your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>BM:</strong> I’m a lover of interior design. So, you will find me in my off time winding down at night maybe flipping through interior design magazines or even during the COVID-19 pandemic reading interesting articles online. Those are the things that relax me. Anything that sparks creativity, that's definitely what relaxes me.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What do you want your lasting impact to be?

<strong>BM:</strong> Besides the fact that I want all who I mentor and inspire to pay all of their experiences and knowledge forward to others, I would say that I want to be remembered as the one who not only gets the job done, but gets the job done well. I don't ever want to be considered average. I want to be the person whom a client describes as ‘She's good at what she does! And, we appreciate her, respect her, and love how knowledgeable and professional she is.’ That's the impact I want to have.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. Are you ready for some rapid-fire questions?

<strong>BM:</strong> Sure.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>BM:</strong> Challenging, rewarding, difficult, different and... I want to say fun. But yeah, it's fun, just not all the time. Ha! I’ll say interesting instead.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s the first thing you do when you get to work in the morning?

<strong>BM:</strong> The first thing I do every day is check my e-mail.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What about the last?

<strong>BM:</strong> The last thing that I do is check my task list for the day and make sure everything that was slated for the day is completed, or that I followed-up if it's not complete.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s your go-to lunch order?

<strong>BM:</strong> If I'm in the office, it's SweetGreen. Our team loves SweetGreen. I usually order a Kale Caesar Salad.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Where do you see yourself in five years?

<strong>BM:</strong> In five years, I see myself working at the c-suite level as an executive.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Love that. What’s something about yourself that your co-workers may be surprised to learn?

<strong>BM:</strong> Hmm, probably that I absolutely love to draw. I don’t get to do it as much. But, it’s a passion.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> And what’s the most interesting thing we may find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>BM:</strong> Oh, wow! I don't know! Nothing on my desk, I'm borderline OCD so you definitely would not find anything on my desk besides my computer. Let me look in my bag, hang on. This is going to sound so strange, but I think my fellow female colleagues would appreciate this. I have toe guards in my bag because my construction boots, you know the boots I used to hate, sometimes kill my toes! I have to make sure I put them on before I put on my steel toe boots.

[gallery columns="2" size="large" type="slideshow" ids="3530,3529,3527,3528"]

The skull which consists of three parts, upper skull bone and two lower jaw bones, weighs roughly 2,000 pounds, with an additional 1,000 pounds for the embedded structural supports. It was a successful delivery and placement, without any major issues. This was the first shipment, which was requested by the contractor, so the front entrance doors could be installed. The rest of the whale will be shipped to the site a few weeks in advance of the installation, post substantial completion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Has everyone had enough of quarantine, and don’t you miss cultural experiences? I truly believe that the public will come back to cultural spaces like museums, simply because they are a necessary part of being human, connecting with shared values and experiencing something beyond the daily norm. The question is <em>how long before these spaces are open, and how can visitors have confidence that institutions are taking the necessary steps outlined by the CDC</em>? Returning visitors will want to safely engage with cultural experiences when they feel it is safe to go back to work, send children to school, enter places of worship, Home Depot, or the mall… How is visiting a museum different?

Yes, going to a museum is not a primary need to survive, but having a live cultural experience (not a Zoom, television, or virtual experience) is something many people enjoy and have deeply missed. At its base, the cultural / museum experience requires leaving your house, going to an interesting setting, engaging with an activity of interest, maybe with a friend. Many people need this, are used to it, and want to come back to it.

For future planning for cultural institutions, in many regards, building operators and professionals need to think—how is our museum experience <em>different</em> than visiting other public buildings where people will <u>want</u> to visit? How will visitors make the emotional leap from “want” to “need?”

Breathing shared air is a major concern for visitors. In this post we will discuss recommendations on how to improve filtration / treatment of that air, and help you prepare to communicate those improvements to your constituency.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3543" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/museum_edit.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="970" />

First, a case study involving an ongoing project that is ready to start digging! I have a client which is planning a $30M church, has already bought a property, has construction financing in place, and has permits to construct. Their recent question: “With COVID-19 being spread through the air, will members feel it is safe to come back to church?” This prompted them to question if they should change the HVAC design to make it more safe (like a hospital) and have our planned building react to the pandemic? My response was “not really,” and here’s why:
<ul>
 	<li>Imagine the cost and disruption if all public buildings were required to have hospital-grade HVAC systems? These types of systems are much more expensive because they have higher requirements for systems separation, required air changes, filtration requirements, and very complicated pressure relationships. The possibility of public buildings being changed like this is unlikely, in my opinion, because the benefit is not worth the cost (except in hospitals!).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Sanctuary seating (pews) are setup to support physical distancing from other families, but families can sit together. You can close every other row, just like it has been done at the White House press briefings. Yes, it is fewer seats, but migration of members back to live church will take time. Density will come back as higher public confidence returns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>The drawings are ready to file for building permit and get competitive pricing. Any delay to this process for making design changes, will cost a lot for redrawing and delays. Time is money.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Are there operational changes and tweaks to the system that is already designed to meet current building codes? Absolutely, keep reading. Changes to building operations, including the operation of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, can reduce airborne exposures. Mechanical engineers knowledgeable with your facility can help develop a specific plan to address concerns, which in turn will allow you to communicate to your stakeholders an actionable plan that is science-based.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>As for building code changes, it is still too early to know how or if building codes will change. That is a complicated process. It takes a long time to modify ASHRAE standards, and then each jurisdictional authority has to adopt the new standards. Think of this situation as needing a tactical pivot, until the building codes change in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>For our church project, the project’s explained that there are several actions the church can take, utilizing the currently designed system.
<ul>
 	<li>Increase the amount of outside air, for more air changes, less recirculation which dilutes airborne contaminants. Programmed fresh air purges can be setup before and after services, for increased air changes during increased occupancy. The system was already setup to cool the building under hot humid conditions, but doing this continually will <u style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">increase</u><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> energy costs and be inefficient. Economizers help to regulate fresh air.</span></li>
 	<li>Explore changes to the filters (using MERV 13, 15, or even HEPA filters) to catch a larger number of particulates, airborne bacteria, and viruses. Greater density of filtration increases pressure resistance and utility costs.</li>
 	<li>Add UV-C lights, which have been shown to “deactivate” viruses. However, location and duration of exposure is necessary to be effective.</li>
 	<li>Bipolar ionization units can be added to the coil sections, requiring engineering and adding cost to the specified system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"></p>
To summarize, project professionals are setup to help deal with building projects, whether you have an existing building that needs improvement, or you are planning a new project. Our team has attended webinars from industry partners on HVAC planning, and in response to COVID-19, and it is strongly encouraged to take a scientific approach with MEP engineers. <a href="https://www.setty.com/recovery-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here</a> to see one engineering group out of many that are publishing papers. Engineers, energy, and commissioning professionals provide a range of facilities / maintenance and personal protective equipment basics, fast interim adjustments, and mid- to longer-term recommendations to include energy considerations. There is an emphasis on tuning-up existing HVAC and building control systems and control sequences, ventilation air, and particulate filtration.

Modern HVAC ventilation and filtration systems can actually reduce transmission and risk, if properly run. ASHRAE intends to provide guidance on managing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 with respect to the operation and maintenance of HVAC systems in buildings. ASHRAE is a global membership-based engineering organization with the intent to “advance human well-being through sustainable technology for the built environment. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and sustainability within the industry.”

In a separate announcement on the operation of HVAC systems to reduce COVID-19 transmission, ASHRAE states: “Ventilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems can reduce the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 and thus the risk of transmission through the air. Unconditioned spaces can cause thermal stress to people that may be directly life threatening and that may also lower resistance to infection. In general, disabling of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems is not a recommended measure to reduce the transmission of the virus.”

Back to fear and public cultural experiences… Once you have a well-advised plan to open, communicate to the public how you are prepared to have a safe environment. Visitors will return when they believe it is safe, when they feel other people will respect their “physical distance bubble,” and we have adequate safety measures like hand-washing / hand sanitizer stations, high cleaning standards, and oh, yes, interesting cultural experiences to offer again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garykmao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Mao</a>, Cost Consultant at MGAC.</em>

---

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Welcome to the Blog, Gary! Tell us what you do at MGAC.

<strong>Gary Mao:</strong> I’m a Cost Consultant with the Cost Management / Project Controls team here at MGAC. I help advise our clients on how to manage their budget, usually throughout the development phases of a project. Sometimes, that will spill over to change orders and such throughout construction. To me, I see it as any sort of problem-solving for the client on the budget side. I’d say the job can be fun and challenging in its own ways.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Which projects are taking up the most of your time right now?

<strong>GM:</strong> I have a couple on my plate right now. One is the Mirman School project, it’s a K-12 independent, co-educational school for gifted children in Los Angeles, and they’re adding a new Learning Center on their campus. I’m working with the architect, the school itself, and the contractor to essentially put together an estimate for the new learning center that’s within the school’s budget. Another is the interior fit-out of an entire floor within a UCLA medical office. Again, this project is a group effort that involves the architect, the owner, and the contractor. This one is requiring a bit more work because there have been quite a few changes throughout the process.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> And how did you find yourself here at MGAC?

<strong>GM:</strong> Before MGAC, I worked with a General Contractor in Orange County, but I wasn't sure if it was the right fit. My good friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayson-musngi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jayson Lacno-Musngi</a>, and I went to college together, and he had been working at MGAC for a bit and told me about an open position on the Cost team. It had some overlap with my past working experience, so I applied, met with some members of the MGAC team, and it just worked out.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. And how long have you been with MGAC?

<strong>GM:</strong> I've been with MGAC for 3 years now.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What were you doing prior to that GC job? Was that your first job out of college?

<strong>GM:</strong> Yeah, that was my first job out of college. I was part of their landscape team and most of the projects we did were for local municipalities and the State of California.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Did you always know you wanted to be a Cost Consultant? What did you want to be growing up?

<strong>GM:</strong> No, in college, I studied civil engineering. Growing up, I wanted to be a pilot, probably like a lot of kids do, but after going through high school, I realized how much I loved art history, mostly architecture, and that was one of my passions. But, as I was choosing my major for college, I decided to lean towards something a little more practical, which led me to civil engineering. Deep down, I’d say I still have a great passion for art history.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What would your younger self think about your current job path?

<strong>GM:</strong> I’ll admit, I think my younger self would be a bit disappointed that I’m not a pilot! But, at the end of the day, I think I would’ve been a bit surprised at where I ended up, but also understanding. I think growing up, especially in high school, I had so many ideas of what I wanted to do. And as I got older, I just knew those ideas would keep evolving and I would always somehow make them work.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Have you learned anything interesting on the job?

<strong>GM:</strong> One of the more important things I've learned is probably to continue being flexible, knowing that you have to be able to adjust to fit the client’s needs. Cost consulting was new to me before MGAC, especially in the preconstruction phases, so I had to learn from the get-go, learn to support my clients in any way possible, and at the same time, not lose sight of the bigger goal at the end of the day, which is to make sure that the projects have the most potential to be successful.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What do you find to be the most rewarding aspect of your job?

<strong>GM:</strong> When the project closes, I love knowing how many people worked together on it. At first, projects usually just start off as ideas, then through people being a part of the project and working together, it becomes this actual physical thing. Sometimes at meetings, it amazes me to see the amount of people sitting together, trying to accomplish a common goal. And the result of all that hard work, seeing it all come together, is really cool. It’s definitely a rewarding experience at the end of the day.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. And how would you say your work makes an impact on your community?

<strong>GM:</strong> In a bigger picture, I’d say I contribute, on a small scale, in creating the future of our communities. From working on projects in academia, healthcare, or communal spaces, I like to believe these projects and future infrastructure will have a role in improving people’s lives. To me, at the end of the day, that includes students having newer and better facilities for their education or families and friends having a beautiful space to connect and perhaps learn something new. Also, I get the pleasure of working with some great minds on some unique projects and that’s definitely a bonus.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Any favorite on-the-job stories or memories that illustrate what it is you love about MGAC?

<strong>GM:</strong> In the Los Angeles office, we have an open office design, and it can get kind of quiet sometimes when everyone is focusing on their projects. But I’d say my favorite moments are when someone randomly blurts out a question that ends up starting a whole discussion throughout the office, whether it’s job-related or just a random topic. It’s always great seeing people working together and enjoying each other’s company.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What gives you energy when you wake up in the morning?

<strong>GM:</strong> I’d say meeting the challenges that each day brings, starting with feeding my two dogs, who wake up way before I do and will whine until I put food in their bowls.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How about your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>GM:</strong> Before the pandemic hit, I used to go rock climbing after work. I got into climbing back in college and have kept it up ever since. But now, with the gyms being shut down in Los Angeles, I just run as much as I can, wherever possible and also do some at-home yoga.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Great! Now let’s move on to some rapid-fire questions. Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>GM:</strong> Working with really smart people.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>GM: </strong>The first thing I do is probably check my schedule or to-do list, then check my e-mail. One of those.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What about the last thing?

<strong>GM:</strong> Last thing I do is make my schedule or to-do list for the next day. And probably check my email.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> You’re organized! What’s the strangest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>GM:</strong> The strangest thing… Honestly, my work bag is pretty typical. I guess you might find some cough drops or candy.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What can’t you leave your home without?

<strong>GM:</strong> Probably my headphones.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Most people say their phone!

<strong>GM:</strong> I guess those go hand-in-hand. But headphones is definitely a must!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s your go-to lunch order?

<strong>GM:</strong> I usually make my own lunch and bring it to work. Actually, you know what, I'm going to get called out on that. I work pretty close to the office, so I usually walk home and make my lunch there. I don’t actually bring it to work. But, foodwise it could be leftovers, or my go-to-whipped-together lunch would probably be brown rice with some meat or curry.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s convenient!

<strong>GM:</strong> Yeah, it is. I guess I really don’t have an excuse of ever being late.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s the most-used app on your phone?

<strong>GM:</strong> I would say Instagram, but I also think Google Maps. Everyone has to use maps, right?

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s a book that changed your life?

<strong>GM:</strong> East of Eden by John Steinbeck.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How about a favorite quote?

<strong>GM:</strong> “Courage is found in unlikely places.” – JRR Tolkien

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What’s something your co-workers might not know about you?

<strong>GM:</strong> I’m sure some of them know, but I love rock climbing outdoors and indoors, and that’s been a passion of mine for a long time. I’ve also recently started getting into taking pictures of nature while on backpacking trips, that's really my favorite thing. Last year, I went to a backpacking place called Havasupai, an Indian reservation down in Arizona, with my girlfriend for four days, and it was great. Rock climbing-wise, I go to Bishop, California once a year with my friends and go bouldering. Another random thing would probably be that I’ve played the cello since grade school.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What do you want your lasting impact to be?

<strong>GM:</strong> I want to be known as a guy who can help solve problems. Growing up, my parents always instilled that in me. They always said: “Try to figure out how to solve problems the best you can, because that's how you can make an impact in other people's lives.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1973, Paul McCartney’s smash theme “Live and Let Die” topped the charts, was nominated for an Academy Award, and left Bond film junkies around the world with the perfect excuse to crank their car stereos to max volume. The song’s tense transitions between innocence, optimism, pessimism, and practicality might make it a contender for musical anthem of 2020. One line we can probably all relate to is: “When ya got a job to do, ya got to do it well.”

And there has been no more pressing force to do our jobs well than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mediocre and status-quo are not acceptable; we have to face our challenges with grit, character, and a double-shot of belief that together we can win. The pandemic has forced us all to adapt our work to new norms, methods, and tools. Web meetings and conference calls fill our days like never before. Names like “Zoom” and “Teams” have become verbs as we describe how each day has been sliced and diced into one web meeting after another. Even our kids spend their days switching between online classrooms, virtual music lessons, video cooking classes, and video chats with friends.

It is interesting to note that the new norm was not made possible by a brand-new innovative technology. There is nothing inherently cutting edge about web meetings and working remotely. In fact, the pandemic has simply forced us to use “older” technologies in new and more expansive ways. What might be the most impressive innovation has been the speed with which many organizations shifted day-to-day operations into a new remote context. For most, they accomplished this major transition using existing technologies. But, most of these endeavors were hastily implemented to address the demands of today, with precious little thought about scalability or reliability. What happens tomorrow?  What about next month and next year?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3592" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/callout_2.png" alt="" width="1726" height="400" />The burning question is: where do we go from here? And how can the implications of the pandemic enable us to better leverage existing systems, today’s infrastructures, and future technology deployments. As project and program managers, we have already begun to answer this question from the perspectives of technical standards, systems, budgets, and operational impacts. The work has barely begun during these past months, but our clients are pressed for answers as they rapidly adjust their business plans, facility master plans, design projects, capital budgets, and operating expenses. For those clients that are finishing design or already in construction, an accelerated process of aggressive and creative “rethinkering” is underway.

Amidst the crisis, some industries have seen years of planned innovation suddenly unfold in a matter of weeks. One of our healthcare clients saw their occasional use of telemedicine surge from several hundred engagements per month to several thousand per week. Another organization leveraged their asset tracking system to track which equipment and personnel had come into proximity with patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Elsewhere, clients leveraged Wi-Fi to expand their patient waiting rooms to include the parking garage. This allowed patients to socially distance inside their personal vehicles while checking-in and waiting to be called inside for their appointments.

COVID-19 has imposed a devastating reality for colleges and universities: students cannot reliably and safely participate in the campus experience (for now). Remote learning has been the go-to alternative thus far, but remains an inferior option for a wide variety of educational and collaborative activities.  Students (and their parents) are now thrust into a cost / benefit analysis that has led many to take the Fall semester off as they evaluate their options. Institutions are now forced to address a crisis that will permanently alter their business and educational models. Granted, some of these body blows are temporary until a vaccine or other countermeasures can be delivered. But, the reality is that some combination of remote participation and periodic in-person collaboration has been trending in higher education for a decade. The challenges of 2020 have simply accelerated the change and institutions that do not adapt their value proposition, educational processes, and platforms face future challenges.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/callout_1.png" alt="" width="1726" height="400" />As an industry, we need to start by shifting technology from a late-project afterthought to strategic enabler. The traditional timing and approach for estimating, scoping, delivering, and managing these dozens of systems, platforms, and infrastructures is inadequate. Rather than tucking individual systems deep underneath a handful of consultants and contractors, the technology program must be developed, managed, and delivered on its own merits.  Rather than incorporating technology after the space program and floor plans are largely complete, we must consider how technology can enable us to update our aged assumptions. Top of mind samples include potential square footage reductions driven by employee timesharing, efficiencies in classroom space due to remote participation, shifts to support space needs driven by autonomous robotic delivery, and the list goes on.

With compliments to our architectural partners, the role of an “architect” is what’s needed. But, a different type of architect. An enterprise architect with the perspective, expertise, not to mention breadth and depth of knowledge to deliver a cohesive and focused technology project. A specialized technology program management team that can envision and deliver a system-of-systems that serves today’s business needs, while supporting the strategic needs of the future. Every organization, institution, and project is demanding more from its technology platforms. To borrow from Clemenceau who said, “war is too important to be left to the generals,” the continued viability of our institutions will rely in great part on the capability and flexibility of their technology platforms. It is too important to be squeezed into the last five minutes of project coordination meetings. It is too important to be the budget that is raided for savings.

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-tilly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Tilly</a>, Assistant Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Welcome to the blog, Courtney! Tell us what you do at MGAC.

<strong>Courtney Tilly:</strong> I’m an Assistant Project Manager. I work with our Project Managers in supporting and facilitating the execution of project schedules and budgets. That’s basically my day-to-day activity; coordinating with all the parties and making sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to do, while overseeing the budget and schedule.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How long have you been on board?

<strong>CT:</strong> Three weeks now!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> You’re just getting started! How has it been so far?

<strong>CT:</strong> It’s been great. Everyone is really welcoming and informative. As with starting any new job, I’m learning the ropes. But, everyone has been really helpful facilitating and helping me understand what my role is and how we do our job.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> And how about beginning a new job in the midst of the pandemic?

<strong>CT:</strong> I’m lucky to be on-site. But, one thing I did think was weird is that all my interviews were over the phone, and I’m used to seeing people and having face-to-face conversations. So, getting hired by a company that’s halfway across the country with only virtual conversation was a little strange, but it’s all worked out.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s great. Where are you based?

<strong>CT:</strong> I’m in Northern Virginia. I relocated there from Louisiana.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What projects are you working on?

<strong>CT:</strong> I work in the critical environments sector. We are building several data centers. In this day and age of technology and everyone using cloud storage, it is really impactful to see how this sector is growing right now and the demand for all of these facilities in Northern Virginia. Seeing how the world is changing as we become more technological, as well as getting to work on a job that’s helping people do their own jobs right now is really cool.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> So true! We are more reliant on technology than ever now that many of us are working remotely. It’s awesome that you’re helping make that happen. And what about MGAC—what drew you to the company?

<strong>CT:</strong> I graduated in December, so I’m new in starting my career. In terms of internships, I’ve always worked for a general contractor. But going through school, I got my degrees in construction management and finance. It’s really working more on that owner side that led me to MGAC. Being able to use both those degrees and facilitate from project inception to project close-out drew me to this company. Whereas I was working for a GC, now I’m kind of on the owner’s side and being the lead in the project.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> So you have come full circle! Was this always an area you wanted to work in? In other words, what did you want to be when you grew up?

<strong>CT:</strong> I always wanted to be a chef or a baker—so kind of a vast switch! But, going through school and learning more about myself, I always knew I wanted to figure out a puzzle. And also just being drawn to the world around me. Playing as a child, I always tried to stack the tallest tower and learned how to build a strong foundation with LEGO and Lincoln Logs. I was always drawn to the puzzle aspect. I truly flourished in college, especially going through all my engineering courses, focusing on how to figure out that puzzle. Now in my job, I have the final picture and I am trying to assemble the puzzle, but we're creating all the puzzle pieces.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> As a newer member of the team, what skills and experience are you hoping to bring?

<strong>CT:</strong> I think it’s just more of a fresh look. Everything can get a little stagnant when you’re looking at something for so long. I hope to be able to bring a new perspective as to what they’re looking at and the way they’re looking at it. And, hopefully, highlight some of those impactful areas. I’m excited to make sure the job is functioning like a well-oiled machine and there are no hiccups along the way.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a great way to look at things. And where do you hope to take your career?

<strong>CT:</strong> I really want to grow into bigger roles, and hopefully throughout my experience with MGAC, they’ll see me as a true asset and start relying on me for more responsibility. And, as that responsibility grows, hopefully, I’ll be promoted to project manager, senior project manager, etc. Ultimately taking on more responsibilities and becoming a true asset to the company in all aspects of the job.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Even though you are just getting started in this role, have you faced any challenges yet?

<strong>CT:</strong> As I mentioned before, I’ve worked for general contractors, but we built multi-family commercial buildings. I never really knew what a data center was before starting in this role. While it’s still construction, it’s a different kind of construction. Really learning the nuances and everything that goes into these data centers has been really cool.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> No kidding—that’s quite the transition! How do you hope the work you are doing with MGAC will impact your community at large?

<strong>CT:</strong> It’s that whole new age of technology. Although you don’t directly interact with the consumer, the consumer is you and I. Everyone relies on these data centers to push information through the computer, and everyone virtually has a computer in the form of a phone now. Being able to see how much is used and how every single person interacts with technology, you know you’re making an impact.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> On a similar note, what have you found most rewarding about your job so far?

<strong>CT:</strong> It’s been great in the sense that everyone really works as a team. MGAC project leads really just try to aid each other in all aspects of the job, even if they’re on different projects. It’s a nice environment to work in knowing if you have a question, it will always be answered.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What gives you energy to start your day every morning?

<strong>CT:</strong> The first thing would be coffee! Also, knowing how doing my job will really impact the world, and knowing that challenges are ahead of me, but I will be able to take them on.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s awesome. And what is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>CT:</strong> I really enjoy cooking. I tend to go home and cook up a good meal and relax doing that. I put on some good music, maybe have a glass of wine.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Name a book that changed your life.

<strong>CT:</strong> I know it’s a children’s book, but <em>The Giving Tree</em> has really impacted me. The life lesson of giving unto others and always treating others with kindness and you will be rewarded.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a great book. What do you want your lasting impact to be?

<strong>CG:</strong> I nerd out about the world around me and the landscape that I live in. Being in this industry, I think it’s truly impactful that you’re really building the skyline around you—you’re building community. Everyone needs a place to live, to work, to eat, to buy their groceries. Construction is really a great way to facilitate that. If I just do my job on a day-to-day basis, I’m going to have a lasting impact.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Are you ready for some rapid-fire questions? Tell us the first answer that comes to mind.

<strong>CT:</strong> Sure!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Describe your job in 5 words or less

<strong>CT:</strong> Inspiring others, building the future.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Really well-said. What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>CT:</strong> Read e-mails and create a to-do list.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> The last thing?

<strong>CT:</strong> A daily journal of everything I've done that day.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>CT:</strong> I was a Girl Scout growing up, so I’m pretty much prepared, whether it’s a first aid kit or food and drink.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Smart! What can't you leave home without?

<strong>CT:</strong> Coffee, my phone, and Chapstick.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's your go-to lunch order?

<strong>CT:</strong> We’re provided with lunch, so whatever they're serving!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Every day? What a great perk! What's something your colleagues don't know about you?

<strong>CT:</strong> I really love sugar. Any dessert.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's the most used app on your phone?

<strong>CT:</strong> Probably the actual phone. I like to talk a lot.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a new one! Who is someone who inspires you?

<strong>CT:</strong> My mama; balancing work and life and kids and family.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Love that. Where do you see yourself in five years?

<strong>CT:</strong> Working at MGAC, hopefully as a Senior Project Manager by that point, and really starting to take on whole projects by myself.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Nice! And lastly, what is your biggest work goal for 2020?

<strong>CT:</strong> Definitely just diving more into my work and making an impact on that job.

<strong>Faris Aldwiekat: </strong>I am a Project Controls Manager. What I deal with is controlling the cost and schedule of the projects we get involved with. We set the baseline schedules and budgets and we monitor them as the project moves along and suggest any corrective action to keep things on track.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> So, you’re the one who keeps things running smoothly!

<strong>FA: </strong>As much as possible. The thing is, it’s not that you have a plan and stick to it; it’s a dynamic plan all the time. You start with the small information you have at the beginning of the project and then you evolve as it goes and change what is needed. But, the ultimate target is to finish the project on time and within budget. The way of reaching that could vary as you go through each phase; you see things you didn’t see at the beginning. When you build a plan at the beginning of the project, you know a small amount. So, you can’t just stick to the plan that was built on the little information that you had and try to impose it. You need to work dynamically with the changes that you face, and as you become more familiar with the project. Flexibility is a big factor in our work.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How interesting. What led you to this role?

<strong>FA: </strong>I’ve been doing this since I graduated in 2003—I’m a civil engineer, by trade, but have never worked as a civil engineer, per se. I love project management and project controls and have chosen this route since I started working. So, I’ve been doing this for 17+ years. And I joined MGAC exactly a year ago.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Congratulations on your first work anniversary! What attracted you to MGAC?

<strong>FA: </strong>What I found at MGAC is it’s not a small company where you, for example, do one similar project or one specific field. It has multiple disciplines, multiple types of projects. Yet, it's not a huge company where corporate rules and politics play a big part in the job. I appreciate the flexibility I've found and the direct relationship I have with management. You communicate, and they hear you, which I didn’t find in big corporations I worked for—and even the smaller companies as well.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> And you work out of MGAC’s Toronto office?

<strong>FA: </strong>Yes, I’ve been here in Canada for five years now. I was living and working in the Middle East before that—I’m from Jordan originally. I was working in Jordan, I've worked on projects in Iraq, and in Saudi Arabia as well. I also lived in Sudan for a while. I emigrated to Canada in 2015.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> As a child in Jordan, what did you want to be when you grew up?

<strong>FA: </strong>To be honest, I didn’t have a specific target in my mind! I was good at school; my grades were always good. But I didn’t know what I wanted. So, I just let go, and kinda fell into engineering.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Sometimes that’s the best approach, isn’t it? Not forcing choices, but letting things fall into place.

<strong>FA: </strong>Yeah—I was lucky, I guess. But, it’s not a very good plan looking back. I don’t recommend that for my kids!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Haha. Still, it sounds like you found a good fit in this field.

<strong>FA: </strong>I have an analytical mind. I understand numbers, which is what I need in my job. I deal with numbers all day. I deal with analysis and evaluating the situation and measuring multiple factors to come up with a final conclusion. I think my mind is built that way, and I'm in the right field.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What would that kid think about your current job today?

<strong>FA: </strong>To be honest with you, I don’t know. I think it would not only be about my work; I came from a suburban area in the capital of Jordan, Amman. And now, I live in Toronto, one of the biggest North American cities. And I’ve completely loved it, where the city has taken me in my career. I think young Faris would be fascinated. He'd say, “Wow, look at what you've done and how far you've come!”

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Yes, what a journey! When you joined MGAC, what new experience and perspective did you bring?

<strong>FA: </strong>I brought some senior experience into project controls and exposure to different types of projects. MGAC is more into building projects, while I have done that, I also bring experience in infrastructure projects: wastewater, water, and transit projects.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s awesome. What challenges have you faced in your first year?

<strong>FA: </strong>Well after 5 months at MGAC, the senior manager who hired me, and who I've known for a long time, decided to resign. That was the biggest challenge. But, the transition was extremely smooth. The company does a good job at accommodating these types of changes. That really ties into what I was saying earlier, when you have a company that’s close to its employees and listens to them, these kinds of changes can be resolved in a smooth way.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?

<strong>FA: </strong>I work on wastewater treatment plant upgrade projects. We work on few around Toronto, and when COVID-19 hit, we were part of the essential businesses; the government allowed us to continue. That tells you what we’re doing is directly impacting the community around us.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What at MGAC, so far, has made an impact on you?

<strong>FA: </strong>I think the simplicity. You do your job, you do it well, and you'll be recognized. And that’s happened. It’s only been a year, and I already feel that recognition. In other companies, you stay for ten years and no one knows your name. It’s different here. It’s simple, it’s efficient, and it’s working.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What have you found most rewarding about your job so far?

<strong>FA: </strong>I think what I like most about my job is seeing the final product. You're able to see the results of all of your hard word. There are other professions where you don't get that. But, working in building and construction, I see the project growing day-by-day. That gives me satisfaction and a purpose. And I don’t mean that other professions aren’t important, but what we do you can touch, and everybody can see it. It gives you that feeling of immediate satisfaction. That’s an achievement on its own.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What gives you energy?

<strong>FA: </strong>New things. Doing things over and over again is not something I enjoy. At work, if I see repetition, I start to get bored. I think that's why I enjoy what I do so much. I show up each day and there's always a new challenge or something that's changing.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a great answer. What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>FA: </strong>Reading a book and getting good sleep. I read probably at least half an hour to an hour. And I make sure to sleep eight hours, no compromise!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a good rule to have! What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?

<strong>FA: </strong>I have to work out. Forty-five minutes to one hour, every day.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Name a book that has changed your life.

<strong>FA: </strong>Not to that extent, but there’s <em>The Untethered Soul </em>by Michael A Singer. That book changed something in me; it opened my mind to a new way of dealing with life. How to accept actions. You are too small in this universe. It’s not your job to control everything, but to accept and observe what life brings to you. It has had a big impact on me.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> How about a quote that inspires you?

<strong>FA: </strong>There’s an Arabic saying: ﺳﺎﻋﺔ ﺻﺒﺮ اﻟﻨﺼﺮ إﻧﻤﺎ. In English, it’s “Victory is but an hour of perseverance.” Give it one more hour. It’s not that it will take one hour, per se. But if you're working on a project and you spend 20 hours on it, all the information is there, and you think you’ve done a good job. But, leave it, and come back for one hour. You will have amazing results. Even in stressful times, if you have a bad day, just be patient for another two to three days. Don’t say, “I give up. That’s it.” Everybody has problems. But, if you get 90% of the way there, and you give up on the last 10%, you lose everything. The 90% you had spent is useless, because you didn’t give it the additional 10% it needed.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s a wonderful way to look at things. What do you want your lasting impact to be?

<strong>FA: </strong>In my kids. I want happy kids, and I want my kids to grow up and realize that I did everything I could to make them happy. I don’t care what they achieve or what they will be—I want them to be happy. That’s my mission.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Now we’re going to ask a few rapid-fire questions. Sound good?

<strong>FA: </strong>I’ll do my best!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Describe your job in five words or less.

<strong>FA: </strong>Plan, monitor, control, and adjust.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Nice. What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>FA: </strong>I write my to-do list.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> And the last thing?

<strong>FA: </strong>I go through the to-do list. See what I have achieved, probably remove some of them or postpone. And if there’s anything I need to carry over to the next day, I’ll do that.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>FA: </strong>I have our garage door opener on my desk. I don’t know why I have it here. I’ve probably had it on my desk for six months!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What can't you leave home without?

<strong>FA: </strong>My phone, of course.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's your go-to lunch order?

<strong>FA: </strong>Anything; I don’t have a routine. I eat something that fits into my diet.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> What's the most used app on your phone?

<strong>FA: </strong>Google. I don’t have any social media. I don’t have Facebook. I don’t have Instagram. I don’t even know what some of them are! And you know what? The good thing about Google is that it understands you. After a while, you don’t have to ask. If you change your mind, Google will discover that and will adjust to show you what you want.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> That’s so true. What's been your biggest work goal in 2020?

<strong>FA: </strong>We’re trying to implement new systems and software programs in our department. We’re also working on building the team and trying to get more integrated with other departments. That’s the main target for this year and 2021.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong></span></span></b> Where do you see yourself in five years?

<strong>FA: </strong>I don’t know! To be honest with you, life has rewarded me so far in ways I hadn't planned. So, I do my job the best way I can, and believe more good will come. If you’d asked me this question five, six years ago, I'd have given you a detailed answer. Every year, I've had a detailed plan and every year things have worked out better than my original plan. So, I stopped doing that. Just do your work, be honest, and good things will come.

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-lippincott-195b0b196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Lippincott</a> gives us a tour of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dwight-d-eisenhower-memorial/125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight D.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi. My name is Kevin Lippincott, and I'm a Project Manager at MGAC. Let's get moving!</em>

<em>With the U.S. Capitol Building in the background, I'm joining you from the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial. The client, U.S. General Services Administration or GSA. Opened to the public in September 2020, the national Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Park is available 24/7, and free of charge.</em>

<em>Each tapestry panel, 600 panels in total, is approximately 3 feet wide by 15 feet tall, installed onto the high tension cable net system which spans an area of 450 feet wide by 90 feet tall. Throughout the duration of this project, MGAC was directly responsible for coordination between the artist fabricated elements, roughly $8 million dollars of stainless tapestry panels, and the highly customized steel components the art was installed on, with custom-made cable net system you can see here.</em>

<em>Hope you enjoyed seeing the completed National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial. Follow us to see MGAC's next move!</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisperruna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Perruna</a>, MGAC’s newest Senior Vice President. A seasoned real estate professional with two decades of experience as an architect, owner’s representative, project manager, and business leader, Chris has managed over 3,000,000 SF with a combined value of $750M throughout the New York metropolitan region.

Prior to joining MGAC, Chris spent nearly a decade at <a href="https://www.gardiner.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gardiner &amp; Theobald</a> where he started as an Assistant Project Manager and worked his way up to Director of Project Management / Owner’s Representation. He then took on the role of Senior Vice President / National Director at <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JLL</a> where he was their New Jersey market leader, directing all project management activities per local, regional, and national assignments. As Senior Vice President, Chris will be leading a team of project managers in our New York office, directing project management services and expanding the firm’s work throughout the tri-state region.

“I am truly excited to be a part of MGAC’s growth in the New York metropolitan market, coupled with the opportunity to work with some of the most interesting clients and projects in the industry,” Chris says. “What impresses me most about MGAC is the level of talent and integrity our folks bring to the table.”

“Chris is enormously well respected in the industry and approaches his work with intelligence, collegiality, and humility,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, Founder and President of MGAC. “MGAC has managed over $1B in projects in the New York / New Jersey market in the last decade.

Chris was born in Rockland County, New York, and currently lives in Millington, New Jersey. Outside of the office, you can find him spending time with his family: coaching his son and daughter in youth sports, going to the beach, and taking long walks with their dog—”anything that can get us out of the house,” he says. He also enjoys researching the stock market and investing in young and innovative growth stocks, which he shares on Twitter to a growing audience of 40,000 followers.]]></content:encoded>

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>What we are currently seeing in the market, sort of post-COVID is a little bit of reluctance from the capital markets to invest in some of these projects, even with three and a half million residential units short here in California. And part of the hesitancy, from what we have gleaned from our industry colleagues and friends out there, is where is the bottom? And it's really a bit of an unknown in terms of we haven't really seen construction costs lower. The supply chain is still strong from the standpoint of primary materials, building materials.</em>

<em>And so, there are a lot of investors that are just, sort of, waiting it out a little bit. And a lot of the conversations that we're having are, even if you are starting to plan for and get a project entitled now, you're three to four years off of occupation, and completion, or substantial completion of that development. And this housing crisis, as we have seen from the trends, is not necessarily going away. People aren't fleeing from California. In fact, what I think we're seeing is a little bit more need for more affordable housing than the standard status quo. So, I think there's going to be an increase in that.</em>

<em>From the standpoint of affordability, or financial modeling, to include some of those components, we really haven't seen much of a change. But what we're seeing is more phased development.</em>]]></content:encoded>

VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION

<em>So, micro-format housing is really a response to young adults entering the workforce. They're priced out of the housing markets that exist now in a lot of the large cities. You've seen these things in Tokyo and in Hong Kong they're basically, adult dorm rooms, if you will. That's kind of a negative way to spin it, but they're very small footprint, and they usually have shared amenity spaces.</em>

<em>Now, what's different in the way that it's being looked at now in some larger cities, plus Seattle and Los Angeles, is local jurisdictions are actually disqualifying micro-housing if it has shared amenities. So they're actually putting forward now Small Efficiency Dwelling Units or SEDUs. They have their own kitchen, laundry, bathing inside each unit. That's one way forward.</em>

<em>Now, the history on this is, which is very interesting, is Seattle led the way. It started back in 2012 to around 2015. I think they built more than 5,500 units or SEDUs because their housing was much like ours, very limited, and prices were skyrocketing. Initially, there was a large opposition to it. They didn't want micro units because of the fact that it did mean affordable housing in our communities.</em>

<em>So, the legislation changed it, the SEDUs to get a little bit larger. It started around 2017 actually, and onward, they really be focused on making it more affordable, but also not calling it affordable. So, LA has really started to go through the same growth point pains and started to learn I think from some of the things that Seattle experienced.</em>

<em>So, LA in the 2008 financial crisis, development was hit really hard as everybody knows. As a matter of fact, LA was the only major city that stopped building and expanding the housing base. California as a whole from 2011 to 2016 added only one new housing unit for every five new residents. And that's staggering if you think about it because we're a city that's experiencing the things that we are now that could have been prevented had the right legislation been in place. So, there's a gap that needs to be addressed. So, I think that's why the SEDUs are a good opportunity.</em>]]></content:encoded>

—

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Hi Ted! Welcome to the blog. What’s your role at MGAC? Do you work in a specific sector at the firm?

<strong>Ted Silence: </strong>Vice President. I work in the Hospitality group, leading project teams to deliver large, mixed-use tower projects.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>And how long have you been with the company?

<strong>TS: </strong>Four years now.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What were you doing before you came to MGAC?

<strong>TS:</strong> I was working abroad in Edmonton, Canada, as an owner’s representative overseeing the construction of a 29-story LEED Gold office tower, along with the design and construction of a 69-story LEED Gold office and residential tower. When the first tower was complete, my wife and I decided to return to the U.S. to be closer to our families. We chose Seattle, since my wife’s family lived there. I noticed MGAC had a job posting in Seattle for a Senior Project Manager with tower experience. They flew me out to DC to interview and I really enjoyed meeting <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/dermot-ryan/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dermot Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Lee</a>, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>. They offered me the job—and the rest is history.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That’s great. Tell us about your upbringing. What did you want to be when you grew up?

<strong>TS: </strong>I was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. As a child, I was always fascinated with construction. I used to love walking through construction sites, which is not a safe thing to do nowadays! But back then, there were no fences. I was enthralled with how everything was coming together. I knew from a young age that construction was what I wanted to do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>And you stuck with that plan?

<strong>TS: </strong>I did. When I was in high school, I was in a work co-op program; I could work construction to get credit. So, I’m sixteen and they gave me my own saw and air gun, and I thought, “This is the greatest thing ever!” I worked construction throughout high school and college. They say the average person changes their focus in college three times, and I could never understand that. I locked-in what I wanted to do in high school.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> What would that kid think about your current job today?

<strong>TS: </strong>He would think that I hit the jackpot. I love what I do. I feel grateful every day to work with such talented project team members and co-workers.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What impact do you hope to have here?

<strong>TS: </strong>I look forward to helping MGAC build a robust team that can deliver highly successful mixed-use tower projects throughout the U.S.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What challenges have you been faced with so far?

<strong>TS: </strong>There have been times that I have found myself working on three separate projects for the same client with a combined total of seven towers, which is a lot of moving parts! It’s easy to get overwhelmed when you are working by yourself. Luckily, I have an awesome group working with me: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracey-bernardo-1749a818/">Tracey Bernardo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfiesta/">Ryan Fiesta</a>, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/dermot-ryan/45">Dermot Ryan</a>. Together, we’re a strong team. I’ve worked with bigger firms, and there can be a lot of politics and red tape. One thing I love about MGAC is that everyone is really down to earth and easy to work with.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What have you learned during your time with MGAC?

<strong>TS: </strong>I have learned a lot about overseeing hotel projects from our Hospitality Managing Director, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/dermot-ryan/45">Dermot Ryan</a>, and my colleagues <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalestern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dale Stern</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmcgough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirk McGough.</a>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Any interesting takeaways?

<strong>TS:</strong> One of the biggest differences is the FF&amp;E, which stands for fixtures, furniture, and equipment. Normally when I build a project, you build the core and the shell and walk away, and the tenant or resident will move their furniture in. But on a hotel project, you have to coordinate the purchase and shipping and installation of everything: beds, nightstands, desks, chairs, towel racks, everything. There is so much stuff that I normally don’t have to think about! There’s the whole selection process: you build a model room for the owner to view, and sometimes you end up renovating it three times before the owner finalizes the finishes. And then you have to order everything, and there’s always some kind of delay with FF&amp;E. Something is coming from China and it’s delayed, or a ship is delayed at the port and you can’t open a hotel until there's a bed! Sometimes, you ultimately have to rent furniture to finish a hotel on time.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?

<strong>TS: </strong>Knowing that the projects our team works on will be around for one hundred years is amazing. People will live, work, shop, and vacation in the buildings that we help oversee and deliver. When I think about making an impact, I also think about my grandfather. When I was a kid, he would drive me around Red Oak, Iowa, in his pick-up truck and point out all the buildings he constructed. I found myself doing the same thing when my son was young, which gave me great pride.

&nbsp;

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That’s a wonderful story. So, your grandfather worked in construction too?

<strong>TS:</strong> He did. He owned his own construction company. He used to work with his father and his grandfather. My grandfather had two daughters, and the construction company phased out with them. My mother didn't go into construction—but she was very handy!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>So, you really were born into the industry!

<strong>TS:</strong> You could say that! Back in the old days, they would ride the beams up as the crane hoisted them into place. There’s a great picture of my grandfather standing on a curved wood beam in the air. The project he was building was  my mother’s high school gymnasium. And I have another photo on the wall from an old brick church project that my grandfather was able to jack the roof structure up and add another story to the building. As a kid, I thought that was the coolest thing.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What at MGAC has made an impact on you?

<strong>TS: </strong>I really relate to MGAC’s slogan: “We treat your project like it is our own.” Because that's exactly what we do. It’s great to be surrounded by like-minded professionals.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> It sounds like your team is very important to you.

<strong>TS: </strong>Exactly. Everyone at MGAC is so dedicated, and they all truly want to do a good job and have a satisfied customer.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s awesome. What have you found most rewarding about your work?

<strong>TS: </strong>Having a satisfied client. Finishing a project on time and turning it over to a happy client is very rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Is there a favorite project you’ve completed in your time with MGAC?

<strong>TS:</strong> One that comes to mind was the Oaksdale Campus in Renton, Washington. Our client had just bought a five-building business complex and hired us to spruce up the campus. By the time we left, we had transformed it with new landscaping, painted exteriors, new signage and renovated interior spaces including the lobbies, fitness center, conference room, and restrooms. It was great to see the transformation. And we were even able to save a bit of money. The project came in quite a bit under budget, so the owner was extremely happy. That’s a good place to be.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What gives you energy?

<strong>TS: </strong>Working with a project team of talented professionals energizes me. You learn something new every day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>How do you start the morning off on the right foot?

<strong>TS: </strong>I love listening to classic rock in the morning to get me going, while I drink coffee or green tea.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>So, you’re an alternating tea- and coffee-drinker?

<strong>TS: </strong>Yep! but I drink decaf coffee and tea.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>TS: </strong>With the COVID-19 pandemic, everybody is working longer hours than usual at home. It can be hard to stop working since you don’t have to commute home. I try to force myself to stop working at a reasonable time. My wife and I enjoy going for a long walk around the neighborhood. I also enjoy catching up on the evening news to see what is going on in the world. Sometimes, I’ll work in the garage on my car or other projects.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s a good point. It really is so important to self-enforce the end of the workday right now.

<strong>TS:</strong> I hear it from everyone, even my son who’s a financial analyst. He’s working long hours from home. You have to pick a stopping point, otherwise, you’ll just work away your entire night. You need some time to unwind, so your brain will relax.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Name a book that changed your life.

<strong>TS: </strong><em>The Millionaire Next Door.</em> It’s about living below your means in order to avoid debt and save money.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> Sounds useful!

<strong>TS:</strong> It really is. What I found most interesting was that it teaches you that you don’t have to go to Saks 5th Avenue to buy your suit; you can go to JC Penny’s or wherever. And that’s what millionaires do. They don’t live in mansions; they live below their means. Oftentimes, people don’t even know they are millionaires. That’s how you accumulate wealth.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>How about a favorite quote that inspires you?

<strong>TS: </strong>General Patton once said, “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” As project managers, we are forced to make important decisions in a timely manner—sometimes with limited information—in order to keep the project team moving forward so we can finish the project on schedule.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>That’s a great quote. It’s applicable to so many projects.

<strong>TS: </strong>I'll tell you why I like it. So many people have a hard time making a decision. They want to wait and drag it out. But, on a big construction site like a tower project, you may have 300 workers in the field. And when there's a question on how to handle something, say a rebar detail so they can pour concrete, they need to know now. If you don’t make a decision quickly, you’re holding up the project and causing delays.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What do you want your lasting impact to be?

<strong>TS: </strong>Great quality projects that stand up against the test of time.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>At this point, we like to ask a few rapid-fire questions. Let us know the first answer that comes to you!

<strong>TS: </strong>Okay!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Describe your job in 5 words or less.

<strong>TS: </strong>Leading project teams to success.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>TS: </strong>I review my meeting calendar and scan e-mails to prioritize the workday. I say to myself, “What is the most critical thing I need to do today?” and that goes to the top of my list.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What's the last thing?

<strong>TS:</strong> Similar to what I do first thing, I take a look at my meeting calendar for the next day and prioritize the tasks that need to be completed first thing in the morning.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?

<strong>TS: </strong>I have incense on my desk at my home office. I burn it to help relax during the day, though I couldn’t do that at the MGAC office!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> What can't you leave home without?

<strong>TS:</strong> My iPhone.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What's the most used App on your phone?

<strong>TS:</strong> The calculator. We get a lot of proposals for change orders and other things from consultants. I’m always spot-checking their math.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What's your go-to lunch order?

<strong>TS: </strong>When I’m in the office, a garden salad with salmon or a spinach egg wrap.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What about now that you’re working from home?

<strong>TS: </strong>My wife does a cleanse once a year, and this year I agreed to do it with her. So, all I eat at lunch is a salad and half an avocado. It’s been the worst two weeks!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Name a co-worker who inspires you.

<strong>TS: </strong>My co-worker <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalestern/">Dale Stern</a>. He and his wife workout every morning, eat healthy, and spend their weekends and vacations hiking all over the world. I inspire to be as active and healthy. If you ever go walking with them, you have to run to keep up with them!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What's your biggest work goal for 2021?

<strong>TS: </strong>It would be to finish the Construction Documents for the <a href="https://cloudvue.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudvue</a> project in Bellevue, which involves three 600-foot towers.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

<strong>TS: </strong>I’d say completing the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/5th-and-stewart-hotel-residences/111">5<sup>th</sup> &amp; Stewart</a> tower in Seattle and perhaps midway through construction on the <a href="https://cloudvue.us/">Cloudvue</a> towers in Bellevue. Each tower project takes three years to construct. When you finish one of these big projects, it’s like a chapter of your life.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> </strong>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?

<strong>TS: </strong>I’m a second-degree blackbelt in Hapkido, and I competed in the Taekwondo Junior Olympics twice.

<em>Last month, MGAC’s West Coast team joined <a href="https://www.coxcastle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson</a> for our first virtual joint-session of the Adapting and Thriving Series titled “Confronting California’s Housing Crisis – In Search of a New and Resilient Model.” The session focused on regulatory, transactional, design, and construction challenges for housing projects.</em>

https://vimeo.com/480587230

&nbsp;

The current economic climate and residual impacts of the pandemic will have long-term financial impacts and consequences to government budgets and projected outlooks. Specifically, townships, cities, counties, and states may experience fractured operating projections, capital campaigns, and tax base revenue shortages. This will likely result from unemployment, CDC mandates, protocols limiting businesses, congressional relief programs, and demographic shifts from populated urban areas into rural and suburban neighborhoods. The video clip included above explores Public Private Partnership (P3) projects in a post COVID-19 world.

These governments, however, still need to do the people's business and serve their communities. Therein lies the opportunity to engage with the private sector to assist with executing the public sector responsibilities. The governments, or the public sector, still retain valuable assets, such as buildings, land, and ministerial or voter remits. Their assets can be leveraged to partner with the private sector to execute programs and initiatives as required. One of the many benefits of this public-private arrangement is it also creates a new tax base of developer lead projects. It can also create jobs within a community, and it can maintain services that the community needs.

Public Private Partnerships, or any other form of alternative delivery or alternative financing, is not necessarily new. We see them with buildings, toll roads, bridges, utilities, and waterways. However, this current economic cycle will inspire new, fresh, exciting, and innovative forms of Public Private Partnerships. To see the full virtual session, click the link below.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Some of the trends that we are starting to see at MGAC is a lot of the public-private partnership work, and prospecting for that. And I think that there are a couple really important reasons why. I mean first, as sort of a result of the combination of COVID, economy, and all of those sorts of things, there are a lot of cities, some counties even, and states that are going to be on the brink if not into bankruptcy. And the only assets they have to really leverage is land and entitlements.</em>

<em>And the government can't just stop or shut down. And so, I think we're going to see, and we're starting to see, certainly from our perspective, more interest, and more appetite for true public-private partnerships where you have government lands, some type of a ground lease, and either a build-to-suite for a government entity or a quasi-government or some type of mixed-use, and even for this residential development, particularly where cities and counties have adopted their housing into their general plans and they have the ability to almost guarantee that type of housing and streamline the process for the approval of the housing elements that they've articulated in a general plan.</em>]]></content:encoded>

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhakemi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Hakemi</a> gives us a tour of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/memorial-university-of-newfoundland/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memorial University of Newfoundland, Core Science Facility</a> in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi, I'm Sam Hakemi, a Senior Project Manager with MGAC currently located here in St. John's Newfoundland Labrador, Canada. Today, I'm going to show you the inside of an iceberg. Let's get moving!</em>

<em>Iceberg's, regular visitors to the island in Newfoundland, were the inspiration behind the design of the core science facility building. MGAC has been involved since the end of the design phase managing various aspects of the project from construction to move and relocation. The building employs the most recent technology and innovation in design and construction. We're going to have a 83-foot long skeleton of a blue whale suspended in one of the atriums of this building. We also have roughly around 150 fume hoods and snorkels, an anechoic chamber, a number of ical environmental rooms, a few biosafety level two areas, and a cryogenic facility that produces liquid nitrogen and helium.</em>

<em>Hope you enjoyed the sneak peek of MUN's science facility. Follow us to see MGAC's next move!</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidimandrolia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Heidi Androlia</b></a></em><em>, Senior Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Hi, Heidi! Welcome to the blog. Tell us what you do at MGAC.

<strong>Heidi Androlia (HA):</strong> I’m a Senior Project Manager. I work with the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/ff-e-procurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FF&amp;E</a> (fixtures, furniture, and equipment) <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/ff-e-procurement">Procurement</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/relocation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relocation Management</a> team.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What exactly does FF&amp;E Procurement entail?

<strong>HA:</strong> We help our clients manage the furniture they're putting into their new building. We’re taking them through the whole design process as far as what type of furniture they need in their space based on how they function. Depending on how early we’re involved, we might be helping them make those selections, putting it out to bid, and awarding vendors. We’re there to advocate for the client and speak on their behalf.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s awesome. There must be a lot involved in that process.

<strong>HA:</strong> People don't always understand how complicated furniture is. It’s really a design within a design. You have the building design, but you’re also designing how the workspace functions. We work with the architectural firm and make sure their design intent is achieved. We also coordinate with general contractors to make sure power and data is set up, so when we go to install, there are no major surprises. Every day is different!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>No kidding! What do you think are some common misconceptions about your job?

<strong>HA:</strong> It’s often misunderstood how much time and effort should go into planning for furniture. I would say that, in general, furniture is an afterthought. Because of this, people don't always fully understand the benefit of what we can offer to the client. But then, 99 percent of the time, at the end of the day, the client says, “We couldn't have done this without you!” If people haven’t worked in the industry, they typically don’t understand how complicated furniture is. There are a million decisions you have to make—just like making decisions for a new building.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s so true. What brought you to MGAC to do this work?

<strong>HA:</strong> My background is interior design. I was working for another firm in DC, a relocation management firm. Prior to that, I had worked as a designer and account project manager for a furniture dealer. I got a LinkedIn message from HR at MGAC, and it just kind of went from there!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Sounds like it was meant to be! And how long have you been on board?

<strong>HA:</strong> 5 years now!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Were you always interested in furniture and design? What did you want to be when you grew up?

<strong>HA:</strong> It was a combination of several things! I did want to be an interior designer, but also a physical therapist or marine biologist. I don’t know where marine biologist came from. I was even convinced I was going to the University of Hawaii to study that! But, I think I always knew I would pursue design in some aspect growing up. My mom and I used to drive around and look at houses; we were obsessed with that! I went in the right direction at the end of the day.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What would that kid think about your current job today?

<strong>HA:</strong> I think she would be impressed. It’s progressed for me throughout my career—being more in the design role, then moving more to the consulting / management role.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b> It sounds like a natural evolution.

<strong>HA:</strong> It has been. I don’t know that I necessarily saw myself doing exactly what I am today, but it’s worked out, and it suits me really well.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s great. What impact do you hope to have here at MGAC?

<strong>HA:</strong> I would say just to help clients to the fullest, and really provide a benefit to them that maybe they didn’t fully understand on Day One. To ensure that at the end of the project, they're thankful and want to work with us again. One of the coolest parts of our job is to see that end result. So, I hope to have the impact of consistently delivering great projects to our clients that exceed their expectations.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What challenges have you been faced with so far on the job?

<strong>HA:</strong> One of the biggest challenges is helping our clients understand how they work. We have to help them get to the point where we have a design and furniture that meets their needs, while at the same time providing a great relocation for them. There’s a lot of education involved, and providing that for our clients can sometimes be a challenge. But, I always want to make sure we’re doing so correctly and accurately, that we’re helping them understand to the fullest what they need to create a great space.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>And adding to that challenge, the process probably varies client-by-client.

<strong>HA:</strong> Totally. And then there are also challenges you deal with every day on a construction site. Things get behind, and when it gets into the thick of things, you’re putting little fires out everywhere, so to speak. Most of the time, with who we’re working with, this is a once in a lifetime project. And you can feel pressure at times because you know they won’t be doing this for another 35 years. So, you also need to think about creating a space that you can add to, take away from, and reconfigure. A space that will stand the test of time.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Speaking of fires, you dealt with a pretty scary situation at a jobsite early in your career. Can you tell me about it?

<strong>HA:</strong> It was probably one of the craziest days of my career. I was in Cleveland for a project. We had a field office directly across the street from the jobsite. At the time, I was based in DC, so for me, sirens were typical background noise. I heard them, and it took me a second to realize, “Wait, I’m not in DC. I’m in suburban Cleveland. This isn’t normal!” I stepped outside, and I just saw flames shooting up. I didn’t know where they were coming from; it looked like maybe a car was on fire. We were actually installing furniture at the same time, and my lead installer called me, and he said, “We’re evacuating. There’s a propane tank that’s on fire.” Luckily, they got everyone out of the building. We’re standing across the street wondering what was going to happen, and then there’s an explosion. It catches the building on fire and blows out the windows. Thankfully no one was hurt because everyone got evacuated in time.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Wow! What a story. Obviously, the explosion had a big impact on the project.

<strong>HA:</strong> It sure did. It’s a perfect example of the fact that sometimes things happen on a jobsite that, even if they weren’t your fault, they are going to have a huge impact on your piece of the project. Coincidentally, we had just started installing a week and a half earlier, right where the explosion happened. So, it was this massive effort to see if we could salvage anything. We were figuring out what needed to be cleared out and how we could get it out—because we weren’t even sure if the building was stable. We basically had to re-plan everything. It was a big challenge, but we came together, and we got it done.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>It’s safe to say you’ve learned a lot on the job! What are some of your most valuable takeaways?

<strong>HA:</strong> No day is ever the same. Expect the unexpected. I’ve also learned how much people value our advice and what we’re here to do. Before I came to MGAC, I didn't even realize this role existed. And once I got into the work, it was surprising to me how much we could offer our clients. It was awesome to see that at MGAC—because you don’t see it everywhere. But, I think it’s something that everyone can benefit from.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?

<strong>HA:</strong> I’ve had the chance to work with a couple of non-profits through my work with MGAC, which can leave a great positive impact because we are helping build a space that directly benefits the community. We’re helping them create a workspace where their employees can go and do important things for the community—and the world. We’re helping their vision come to life.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>And how do you think MGAC has made an impact on you?

<strong>HA:</strong> It’s taught me that you can really find a place to work that values their employees. As the owner, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark</a> makes himself available for anything you need. But, he also puts the onus back on you and says, “I know that you’re the expert in this.” It’s great to have that in a company. They know that they’re hiring the best in the industry.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>That’s great. What have you found most rewarding about your job?

<strong>HA:</strong> We’re here to speak on behalf of the owner; we’re there as their trusted advisor. The most rewarding moments have been seeing them walk through that door for the first time, when the whole staff is there and they’re so excited about their space.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Do you have a favorite memory in particular?

<strong>HA:</strong> One of the best memories I have was working with a non-profit. We had gone through everything, and the project was wrapping up, but there was a minor issue that came up at the end. It had taken a lot to win them over, to get them to trust us. And I was explaining this issue to them, and they said, “You know what? Whatever you say, we’re going to go with. Because you have not guided us in the wrong direction so far.” That was really great to hear.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So cool. What would you say gives you energy?

<strong>HA:</strong> At my job, getting to work on cool projects every single day. And personally, my family and friends. Now more than ever, I try to connect with them as much as possible.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What’s your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?

<strong>HA:</strong> I honestly have to make a to-do list every single day. It helps me align everything, to make sure I know which things have to get done that day, and which can get done three days later. That really helps me manage expectations for the day because something will always come up!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What about winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>HA:</strong> Usually a nice long walk with our dog—we got a COVID-19 puppy! She’s a cavapoo named Ella. Also, reading or watching mindless TV always helps.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>You mentioned reading—what’s a book that’s been significant to you?

<strong>HA:</strong> To Kill a Mockingbird. I remember reading it in middle school, and it was really emotional at times. It opened my eyes to the fact that reading can take you into another world.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>How about a favorite quote that inspires you?

<strong>HA:</strong> “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” That one took me a long time to learn. You stress out about things, and you later realize they weren't that important. It’s something I always try to keep in mind.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>So true. Okay, now it’s time for some rapid-fire questions. The idea is to let me know the first answer that comes to you. Sound good?

<strong>HA:</strong> Yep!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Describe your job in 5 words or less.

<strong>HA:</strong> Making things simple for clients.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>HA:</strong> Definitely make a to-do list. And check e-mail. And get coffee.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's the last thing?

<strong>HA:</strong> I love crossing things off of a list, so checking my to-do list one more time and crossing things off. I’ll even write things down so I can cross them off!

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's the weirdest thing we might find in your work bag?

<strong>HA:</strong> I always have a tape measure in my bag.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What can't you leave home without?

<strong>HA:</strong> Sadly, my phone.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's your go-to lunch order?

<strong>HA:</strong> It would be CAVA. It’s like a Mediterranean Chipotle.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's the most used app on your phone?

<strong>HA:</strong> Since moving into a new home, I’ve been looking for lots of home items, so One Kings Lane and the Target apps have been getting a lot of use.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Name a co-worker who inspires you.

<strong>HA:</strong> I would say, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/susan-smith/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Smith</a>. She works with our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/technology-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technology team</a>. She has worked really hard to bring the benefit of that department to life, and she’s so knowledgeable. I’ve learned a lot from working on projects with her.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

<strong>HA:</strong> Definitely at MGAC, and probably in a Vice President position. We’re working on our strategic planning right now at the company, and our goal is to expand our department to our different offices. So, I think there is going to be a lot of opportunity to help get people on board and understand what we do.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>What's your biggest work goal for 2021?

<strong>HA:</strong> I think both as a department, and personally, our goal is to work on a project that integrates all of the services we offer. We provide a lot of value to our clients when we offer them the full breadth of our services.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At MGAC, we like to measure our success by the legacy we leave behind. After 22 years, Bruce Bieber, a Vice President here at MGAC, is retiring, and we thought it only fitting to look at the legacy he leaves and the lives he's touched along the way. We sat down with Bruce to talk about this chapter in his life, telling him we'd like to document it. As is customary with Bruce, someone who's known for being particularly humble about his work, he told us he thought it would be "boring" but agreed to the interview. What Bruce didn’t know is that we also talked with his colleagues who, unlike Bruce, didn't hesitate to sing his praises.

Twenty-two years is a long time, and Bruce made the most of every minute. Some people just have a job, a place they clock in and out of. Bruce isn't one of those people. He brought a sense of purpose and passion to the work each and every day. He made the impossible possible countless times for our clients and never missed an opportunity to make someone's day along the way. Bruce sets the mark for what we all hope to live up to at MGAC, and he will be sorely missed. That said, the impact of his work will live on for years to come.

<strong>MGAC: How did you get started in the construction industry?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>Bruce Bieber (BB):</strong></span> My first job in the industry was working for a retail developer called Western Development, which is responsible for Georgetown Park, Washington Harbor, Potomac Mills, and a number of shopping centers all around the country. I got involved with them in 1983. After five months of introductory clerical / administrative work, I got sucked into the construction side, the industry I ultimately worked in for 37 years.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: And for a little while you pivoted to law?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> Yes. I was working for Western Development and decided to leave after four or five years. I went to another retail developer that built shopping centers. And I applied to law school to go at night. Then in 1990, there was a recession in the real estate industry, and the company I was working for folded. I’d already been accepted into law school, and the question was, do I go anyway? With three kids in diapers, my wife quite heroically supported my decision to go to law school for four years at night, while by day I worked full-time as a project manager for a local general contractor, NARDI Construction. After four years, I got out and got a job as a lawyer for a firm in Baltimore, where I stayed for a year and a half. Then I went to a firm in Gaithersburg, where I stayed for a year.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: So, what ultimately brought you to MGAC?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I’d been working as a lawyer for two and a half years, but I wasn’t doing the kind of work I'd hoped to do. I got a call from a woman I’d worked with at Western Development. Julia Wright. She was one of the very few people who worked for Mark at MGAC at the time. She said they needed help, and would I meet Mark and have dinner? So, I did.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: And you took the job?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I did. After dinner, I said, “You know what? I like Mark well enough. I'm going to give it a try.” That was in 1998. There were maybe five other people working there at the time: Greta Perry, Rebecca Wilson, Sue Stout, Julia Wright—all women—plus Mark and I. They said they needed a little help for a few months on Discovery Channel stores, which we were doing around the country. That couple of months turned into ten years working with Discovery Channel.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3798 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/new-quote_2.png" alt="" width="3333" height="2271" />

<strong>MGAC: What do you consider to be your greatest accomplishment in your time with the company?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I personally think that being able to maintain your peak client business over a decade is an achievement. To continue to be of service and have a client see value in what we do year-after-year is a testament to our abilities and our value. That it’s not a one-and-done, but a long-term relationship.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: Who were some of those repeat clients?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> Other than Discovery, White Star, Hustler Hollywood, Hilton. For most of the clients I’ve worked with, the relationships have gone on for years. It’s both a personal and a corporate value to maintain those durable, long-term relationships. I’m proud of those achievements.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: You must have some great stories from working with those clients over the years. Any come to mind?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> Because I had a law degree and an appreciation for zoning, working on the Hustler account, was particularly interesting. They sold a product that very much implicated zoning regulations. They didn’t want to run afoul of the law, naturally, so you had to be careful where the lines were, what the limits were. (And honestly, most of what they sold you could get at any mall in America. But there’s a bad boy nature of the name and what it conjures up in people’s minds.) So, the zoning authority of the city or county we were in always took a big interest in what we were up to. They wanted to make sure we were coloring inside the lines. To me, it was an actual intersection of design, law, and construction. Strategic design was necessary because sometimes the naughty stuff had to be separated—you had to be 18 or older to go in there—so how do you do that? We had to come up with design solutions to that very issue. How do you build a facility and be sure it complies with all the code requirements? Because people were paying close attention.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: That’s so true. What other challenges did you encounter working on that account?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> There are always challenges. Because it was somewhat provocative and people got excited about it, we had a couple of occasions where we awarded a general contractor to build it and a third of the way through, the drywall subcontractor would figure out who he was working for and quit. He would say, “I can’t work for that guy. I can’t be a part of this.” So, we had to be careful and learn lessons. I told all the GCs after that, “You have to let everybody know. And if they have any problems, don’t bid it.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: We’ve heard a funny story about a big box that Hustler gave to the office.
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I used to go to an annual retail development convention in Las Vegas with Mark. My admin, Anita—who is still with the firm today working on our FF&amp;E Procurement and Relocation Management team—calls me up and says, “Hey, you got a box from Teresa.” And Teresa is Teresa Flynt, the daughter of Larry Flynt, the founder of Hustler. Unbeknownst to me, with no prior warning or notice at all, she had delivered to our office to my attention this gigantic cardboard box full of all kinds of stuff. It made for a good laugh.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: What’s another favorite project you’ve worked on?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB: </strong></span><a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/hilton-worldwide-headquarters-the-social/204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Social</a> for Hilton. It was an example of a team—and by team, I mean everyone: the client, many layers of consultants, the architect, acousticians, food service—that clicked on all cylinders, all the time. Everybody wanted it to succeed and made sure they did everything and more to make it happen. I always felt like we were working toward a common goal. And living up to that MGAC mantra of “Have fun. Make money. Do interesting work.” To this day, some of those people will get on a Zoom call and say, “Hey, we need to get the gang together and do that again!”

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: And, you built strong relationships around the office as well. We’ve heard you and some co-workers embarked on some epic motorcycle trips over the years?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB: </strong></span>There was one legendary trip in particular, when Walt Layton and Harold Bingham and I went out to Sturgis, South Dakota. We spent three weeks, 6,000-plus miles, riding. And Mark helped us do it. We all brought laptops; did a little bit of work on the way. It was a great time.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: Looking back, would you say there’s a sector within the industry you enjoyed most?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I wouldn’t say that. To me, it’s the people, it’s the team, more so than the process or the product at the end. I really believe that it’s the people, not the thing.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: How has working at MGAC made an impact on you?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB: </strong></span>That saying, “Have fun. Do interesting work. Make money,” that’s an old thing. We came up with that many years ago. We really believed it at the time. And I still believe it. Twenty-two years later, that ethos still prevails in my world.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: How would you describe your approach to the job?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I want every day to have a laugh, to have fun. And I think that, far more often than not, I’ve had fun doing what I do. That’s important to me. I could be a bigger a**hole and have more enemies, and maybe I’d be respected more. But we’re all wired a certain way, and my inclination is to go the route that's more sociable and less a**hole-ish. That’s a deliberate choice. I feel like MGAC has allowed me to be that person for a long time.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: Any regrets?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I don’t think I have any big regrets in my career with MGAC at all. If anything, it’s been more than I expected, frankly. It’s been more productive and beneficial to me and my family than I would have ever anticipated. I didn't think I'd stay there 22 years when I first met Mark. I hadn’t stayed anywhere five years at that point. In that regard, I really couldn’t say that I regret anything.

<strong>MGAC: What’s your favorite memory from your time at MGAC?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I don’t think it’s possible to answer that!

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: What will you miss?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I’ll miss the people. There is that energy that’s almost a fourth-dimensional quality when the team is clicking and productive and working. There is a buzz about it that I don’t suspect I’ll have when I’m retired. I’ll miss the energy of a well-oiled, high-functioning team working together toward a common goal.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: What’s the first thing you plan to do in retirement?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> I’m going to move! We’ll split our time between our place in New Hampshire and find something in South Florida, where my kids are.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: Any advice you’d like to leave behind?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB: </strong></span>Have fun, do interesting work, and make money. And, in that order.

&nbsp;

<strong>MGAC: What do you hope is your lasting impact?
</strong><span style="color: #ec5a4f;"><strong>BB:</strong></span> That’s curious! It’s funny, I don’t know that I view what I do as having an impact, but I hope people will think of me and what I did and smile. I hope that they'll have a fond memory or recollection of me. If I can make people laugh and smile, I've done my job. <strong> </strong>

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidimandrolia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Androlia</a> gives us a tour of the <a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/mlkfuture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library</a> in Washington, DC.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hello. My name's Heidi Androlia, and I'm a Senior Project Manager here at MGAC. Let's get moving! MGAC's FF&amp;E Procurement team was engaged by Smoot-Gilbane to procure and manage all FF&amp;E for the historic MLK Jr. Library renovation. As you walk up to the library, you can learn a little bit about the construction and build of the original building, which was originally designed by Mies van der Rohe.</em>

<em>Here we are in the Great Hall. Many of the same features remain from the original building. The Grand Reading Room features two-story high ceilings and an art installation by Xenobia Bailey. Grab a book, pull up a seat, and enjoy the views. Another furniture partner did a great job installing shelving that houses the many books stored at the MLK Library.</em>

<em>Check out this beautiful new monumental staircase. The offices and workstations got an upgrade too. This rooftop offers great views of the District, an outer furniture to recharge and enjoy the view. I hope you enjoyed seeing what's happening here at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. Follow us to see MGAC's next move!</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O'Connor</a>, Managing Director</em><em> at MGAC.</em>

—

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Hi Ashley, welcome to the blog! Tell us what you do at MGAC.

<strong>Ashley O'Connor (AO):</strong> I am a Managing Director. I work on large programs for MGAC—I do a lot of work with clients that have either big projects or big portfolios. In terms of sectors, a lot of it is corporate or institutional, including government and higher education.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>How long have you been with the company?

<strong>AO: </strong>About four years.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>And what’s keeping you busy these days?

<strong>AO: </strong>I’ve been working on <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>T-Mobile’s Headquarters</u> </a>in Bellevue, Washington since 2017. They have a vision for their headquarters, a strong brand, and they really believe in what they’re doing. It’s been great helping them get there.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Can you tell us more about that vision?

<strong>AO: </strong>The employee experience in the workplace is very important to T-Mobile. It’s not just an office where you have a desk, it’s a space that encourages collaboration, and interaction among team members, and there’s a big-picture employee experience we’re creating. They’re really centered on that. The main building will be LEED-certified. But, they are also pursuing their Fitwel certification, which is really about the employees.

<b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC: </strong></span></span></b>Very cool! What does the Fitwel entail?

<strong>AO: </strong>It’s about a broad view at creating office places that promote employee health and well-being. Considering how employees might get to the campus, where they might exercise, and what they might eat. So, can you ride your bike to the campus? Are there workout facilities and showers? Are there walking trails, and places to eat outside? T-Mobile has really taken it to heart. Everything on the campus is very intentionally done, and I think they have really put the employees front and center.

<strong><b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong> </span></span></b></strong>Sounds like an exciting project. What else are you working on?

<strong>AO:</strong> We’re working on multiple projects with Johns Hopkins University. One is the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-named-as-program-manager-for-new-johns-hopkins-facility-to-be-housed-in-iconic-newseum-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversion of the former Newseum building at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue</a>. It’s a great project. It will be Johns Hopkins’ home in DC, where they will consolidate their graduate programs, offices, and multiple DC facilities. It’s an amazing, high-end building—and it’s incredibly complicated. But the team is great. The building was designed by a well-known architect, James Polshek, and is being renovated by his legacy firm Ennead, with interiors by David Rockwell. The building is being transformed from a museum into an educational and meeting space for the University. It’s really interesting to adapt this very specialized building into something else.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>And talk about a high-profile site, right on Pennsylvania Avenue! Can you tell us about the other projects with JHU?

<strong>AO: </strong>Another great project for Hopkins is the <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/11/02/student-center-design-selected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new student center</a> on their main campus in North Baltimore. It is being designed by Bjarke Ingles; a superstar architect from Copenhagen. A great aspect of the Hopkins program is the caliber of the architecture and the complexity of their challenges and projects. These are really challenging, complex projects. To me, that makes it fun! And in the end, you have these amazing places for the people who use them.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>Nice! Let’s back up a little—what first attracted you to a job at MGAC?

<strong>AO: </strong>I have always worked around real estate. I started in management consulting for Booz Allen where I was advising clients on their real estate portfolios. And then I went on and worked for Skidmore Owings and Merrill and EDAW/AECOM. But I really wanted to work in a firm where I could do interesting projects and have a clear client focus. I was attracted to MGAC because the firm is smaller, and focuses on delivering great work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s great. Does your passion for real estate and architecture go way back? What did you want to be when you grew up?

<strong>AO:</strong> I always liked traveling. I thought at one point about being in the Foreign Service. I’ve lived and worked internationally, which furthered my interest in building, architecture, and planning aspects. I got my master’s degree in urban design. That was driven by my experience across the world, and the joy I found in the cities I have lived, visited, and worked in.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What would that kid think about your current job today?

<strong>AO:</strong> Ha! I think that kid had no idea I would have been able to do this. As in, I never would have thought of it as an actual career path. But I’m glad that I’m able to do what I do. And the fact that it has evolved the way it did is nice. I consider myself lucky that I was able to go around the real estate world in the way I have. I’ve been lucky to be able to have seen it from all sides.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>You mentioned traveling for work. Where are some of the places you’ve been?

<strong>AO:</strong> I’ve always been based in Washington, DC, but I've had offices or “home desks” in other cities as well. I spent a lot of time in New York with previous roles, as well as Miami. My current work with T-Mobile takes me to Seattle often. Then there’s also London, the Middle East, India, Canada, Mexico, Spain. A lot of places!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>As you reflect on your four years with MGAC, what are some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned?

<strong>AO:</strong> I like to think I’m always learning something. If you’ve reached the point where you’re not learning anything new, you need to challenge yourself a little more!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Good point!

<strong>AO:</strong> What we do is always evolving, especially during COVID times. How people use space, how they learn, how we build things—it’s always changing. So, if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s more about always being open to new ideas. We should always ask why things are the way they are and how we can make them better. And there’s no set answer. I think that’s one of the things that’s hard: you have to marry what you know from experience with what’s always going to be changing.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Right. You have to be comfortable with that change!

<strong>AO: </strong>Absolutely. If you’re delivering something for a client, you have to ask yourself, “At its core, what are we trying to accomplish? What is the essence of what we are trying to do?” And if you can keep your eye on that, you can solve all other problems.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s a great perspective. Any particular challenges you’ve faced along the way?

<strong>AO: </strong>There’s that personal challenge of always wanting to do new, and more, and different. And just getting out there and having the bandwidth to do all that you want to do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>And how do you hope taking on those new and different projects might impact your community at large?

<strong>AO: </strong>That’s kind of why I started in urban planning! Cities and places—even just a single building—can be really impactful to people. For every place I have been a part of, I hope the people living in it, working in it, and walking through it are touched by it. I hope that it’s really working for them. I look at buildings and places in a holistic way. I believe they have to be properly designed and properly built. When those two things come together, we create spaces that are lasting and able to serve the people who are part of them. Because buildings and places don’t exist without people.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>So, while you’ve been executing projects from this holistic perspective at MGAC, what about the firm would you say has made an impact on you?

<strong>AO:</strong> I think the nature of the firm. Coming from places that were ranging from big to very, very big, I appreciate having the ability to really focus on clients; to take ownership. At a big firm, it requires a lot of coordination to do anything. But because MGAC is smaller and more nimble—and, I believe, more client-focused—we’re able to get out there and just do exactly what we need to do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What gives you energy?

<strong>AO: </strong>Cities and crowds. People and places. That feeling of walking down a crowded city street, the dynamism of being part of a big group of people. All things that have been very difficult to experience during the pandemic!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>So true, unfortunately. What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?

<strong>AO:</strong> I believe in taking three minutes to empty your mind. It’s hard if there’s always something you think you need to do. Sometimes, I have to set a timer on my phone to make sure I take the time. The world we live in, there’s news coming at you all the time. Forcing yourself to put down your phone and not do anything, for me, has to be intentional. But it’s important.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>It really is. What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?

<strong>AO:</strong> Coffee. I also walk the dog; I get outside for fresh air. It’s often quiet in the mornings, depending on how early it is. That’s a nice way to start the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>What’s a book you’ve read that has made an impact on you?

<strong>AO: </strong>Rainer Maria Rilke’s<em> Letters to a Young Poet</em>. I read it after I had graduated from Duke, before I went to grad school. I was living in France at the time. It’s this tiny slim set of letters, and it’s about the meaning of life. The idea of following your passion and trying to find a calling, or at least something that makes you happy.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>And what do you think your calling is? What do you hope to achieve with your work?

<strong>AO: </strong>You’d like to think that what you do makes a difference. I’d say to leave the world a better place. I think people who do what we do, in the built environment, have an opportunity to manifest that desire in a way other professions can’t, because what we do is physical.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Now it’s time for a few rapid-fire questions. Answer with the first response that comes to mind! Sound good?

<strong>AO:</strong> Alright!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Describe your job in 5 words or less.

<strong>AO:</strong> Missions made real. Yes, it’s MGAC’s tagline, but it really does resonate with me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What's the first thing you do at work every day?

<strong>AO:</strong> If I were in the office, I would always say hi to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gia-axiotis-62105693/">Gia</a>. She was our receptionist, but was recently promoted to join the procurement team as a Project Coordinator. Now that we’re not in the office, going to work means turning on the camera!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What's the last thing?

<strong>AO: </strong>I always say goodbye to whoever is left on the floor. If I’m at home, I turn off my computer and walk away!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Sounds about right! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk at work?

<strong>AO: </strong>I have a huge collection—like, huge—of hotel room key cards. It’s several inches high.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s a new one. What can't you leave home without?

<strong>AO: </strong>My phone. I always have an umbrella, too. That came from my time working in the UK.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>What's your go-to lunch order?

<strong>AO:</strong> Tomato-feta soup from the Pret-A-Manger down the street. It’s delicious. And you get a roll with it, too.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> </strong>What's the most used app on your phone?

<strong>AO:</strong> In the “before times,” I would have said the American Airlines app. But my secret shame is the Daily Mail Online. It’s such trash; it’s news that you don’t need, but it’s entertaining.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong> It’s your guilty pleasure! What’s your work goal for 2021?

<strong>AO: </strong>I’m always looking for the next big problem to solve. love new projects, more projects. I would love to be able to take some of those clients and work with them in some of the cities I know and treasure overseas; so maybe more global work. I get charged by the new and exciting; the next big challenge. We have things in the works that I hope will become the next big challenge.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>That’s a good perspective. You may not know what it’s going to be, but you’re excited to take it on.

<strong>AO:</strong> Right. I’ll find it! And I hope the time will come when we’ll be able to travel more broadly. My American Airlines app isn’t getting a lot of love and attention these days!<strong> </strong>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

<strong>AO: </strong>I’d like to think I could be sitting with a client on a building site in some exotic location. A big city, far away, no mask. Working through the plan for something huge and cool. I don’t know where that would be, but I'm open-minded!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and, along the way, have grown our team and our services in order to take on new challenges. We are proud to have turned some of our clients’ wildest “what ifs” into realities. We have made the impossible possible and made some great friends along the way.

At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. With that said, we are introducing a new series, “25 Years of MGAC.” Each month of this anniversary year, starting next month, we will bring you a story of one of our favorite projects—instances when we have met new and interesting challenges, when we have accomplished something that has never been done before, and when we have had the pleasure of doing work that had a real impact on the communities we are proud to serve.]]></content:encoded>

 Beth: Hi, and welcome to "MGAC Inner Voices." A podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture engineering construction industry. As a disclaimer, we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are, however, experts in our own experience. Our hope is that this podcast will create a space to share our stories and discuss how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. I'm Beth Scully. I am out in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Seattle, and I'm a Senior Project Manager. It's my great privilege to introduce someone who is becoming a fast friend of mine, Bryan Gamez. Bryan, can you begin for all of our guests by telling a little bit about yourself?

Bryan: First, thank you so much, Beth, for taking the time to interview me. As you said, my name is Bryan Gamez. I am an assistant project manager here at MGAC, and I'm in Los Angeles, California. I've been with MGAC for about a year, and I've been in the AEC industry for approximately five years. I started off as an architect, and then I moved into the GC field. I was a GC for a few years, and now I'm here on the owner's side. My background, I am the gay Latino in this field; I have had the pleasure and the privilege to work with potentially a handful of people who identify with my backgrounds. So, I hope that when I share my story now that I can provide a perspective that others may have never thought of. So, I hope that this brings a fruitful conversation to the table.

Beth: Thanks, Bryan. So, we'll dive right into our questions here. So, specifically, how has your identity as a member of the gay, Latino community affected you in your professional spaces? Can you speak to the challenges you've faced in your career because of your identity?

Bryan: As I've navigated my career, I have never really thought of my identity as something that has prevented me from excelling in the field. But, there have been times where I have realized that I haven't been able to be my 100% true self in the workplace. I think that, especially when I was a GC. There aren't many people that you meet in construction that are gay and Latino, and sometimes I think, through my subconscious, I believe that I just assert my masculinity that isn't my true self. And that's affected me after the fact thinking of, like, why can't I be my true self out in the field, and around subcontractors and just colleagues. But, one thing that I really did enjoy when I was a GC were some of my team members; I had the great privilege of working with really quite a diverse team with the women who really took me under their wing and always made sure that they were including me in all the conversations, including me, protecting me out in the field. Because they know that there are people out there that still have not fully come around to the idea of gay people in the workplace. And I hate to say this, but sometimes it is prevalent in the construction field.

Beth: Yeah. Oh, don't hate to say that. That's been your experience. So, you clearly have had to adapt, right, who you are in the workplace in some instances, and I'm wondering what may have motivated that and how it has affected you?

Bryan: Well, interestingly enough, so I grew up in a conservative Latino household. And I have to say that my upbringing has really affected how I am today and who I am today. We had very conservative traditional values of what a person or a man should be. And that has truly affected who I've become as I've gotten older. It was ingrained in my head for years and years, and I didn't fully accept myself, probably not until my early 20's when I came out to my family. And the amount of years it took for me to come around to accept myself, in my personal life, it still hasn't fully transitioned into the workplace because of the lack of individuals I have met in our field, that I can truly say, "Wow, I relate to you, I see myself in you." And to be honest, there haven't been very many people that I've met. As I said, at the very beginning, only a handful that I can say, you know, wow, I see myself in you. And it's sad because usually in this field, most people that are sitting around the table are white, older men who identify as straight.

So, in my head, I have this perceived notion that it's still unacceptable to be gay. Am I making them uncomfortable by being my true self? And those questions I still ask myself every day, sometimes in meetings and out in the field. And I know that it's an unfair question to ask myself because it's preventing me from being my true self. And when I'm my true self, I think that I can excel at everything I do. It's just unfortunate that I put other's comfort in front of mine. That just happens to be what has happened in the past few years.

Beth: Yeah. So, I would imagine, you know, given what you're saying about the way that you were raised, and then in combination with what you face in an industry that is largely white, male, straight, it's probably difficult to pull apart how it has affected you since you're still processing the whole of it, right, you know, chicken or the egg was it? Am I thinking about my family upbringing? Is this affecting me because of the audience I work with most of the time? It's probably an ongoing thing for you, I would imagine.

Bryan: It's a multitude of factors. There have been many conversations, and this is just small talk when people ask each other, you know, how are your families? How are your girlfriends? How are your wives? How are your husbands? It's interesting for me, at least, that I don't really receive those questions, and not being asked those questions has really affected me. And, also understanding if anyone really wants to engage with a gay person at work and what their personal lives are, and to your point, it's just been a multitude of items that have come together that now have made me realize that that shouldn't stop me from being who I am. Just because someone is uncomfortable doesn't mean that I should accommodate them.

Beth: Yes, I mean, you are your best self, right, when you are true to who you are. It's interesting, I had a former experience, and my colleague was a gay man. And he turned to me, and he said, one of our other colleagues had asked him to decide whether our client was gay. And I just remember going, "What? Who cares? Is that really a thing? Can we not get to the place and the time when it's, 'how is your boyfriend? How is your fiance? How is your husband?' Can't we get to that?" But we're not, which is why we're having these conversations, right? And I think it's important that we have the conversation, and we listen to its impact on you. Right?

Bryan: Right. Absolutely. And I think this will open the channels for other people, younger generations, or anyone, not just one generation, but to embrace themselves, embrace their field, embrace their job to the fullest, and really allow themselves to be at the top of their game and not worry about how you're gonna make someone feel uncomfortable just because of who you are. That's what's critical in this conversation, and that's why I'm happy that we're having the conversation.

Beth: Yeah. It's tremendous that we are and that we work in a company and a culture that cares deeply about this.

Bryan: And, I just wanna say that the commitment that MGAC has made to create this conversation will have a lasting impact on me personally and just on the field itself. I hope that people who are listening to this, who are interested in diversity, equity, and inclusion, that they understand that we all have different perspectives and we're all here just trying to, you know, ensure that when we're at work, that it's the success of the project and it doesn't matter what our backgrounds really are, at the end of the day, that will offer diverse perspectives on the issues.

Beth: Yeah. So, Bryan, why is diversity, equity, and inclusion important in the workplace, in your opinion?

Bryan: Diversity, equity, and inclusion is certainly important in the workplace. There's a visibility to diversity that has a direct impact on employees. Most importantly, though, I think that there should be a commitment to equity in the workplace. I think that as a society, we still struggle to provide equal pay to women compared to men; that's unfair. Women and men should get paid the same amount; sometimes women do it better. I mean, that's certainly my opinion. I think having greater diversity in the workplace creates a wealth of information for everyone involved in the project. I think that companies should make a commitment to through metrics in the hiring process for greater diversity and also for greater equity and inclusion in terms of compensation. Those types of commitments. People are gonna be able to do better work. They're able to come to work feeling like they're not being suppressed. I believe that at MGAC, it feels like a privilege to work for a company that wants to hear my voice and wants to hear my thoughts on this. And, it's allowing me to be my best self and also bring my best foot forward to every project that I work on.

Beth: Yeah. How does your unique identity make you a strong asset to the team, Bryan?

Bryan: I would say that as I've gotten older, and through my experiences, I've realized that I've become a great listener. I like to understand people's backgrounds. I like to know where they've come from, what their experiences are. And, that lends itself to a great camaraderie on the project. It lets them know that you know we may be facing a tough challenge now, but I really am here to work with you, work with you, as a team member. I think that I try to approach situations in that way, especially on projects. I don't really think of my identity as something that, now on my current project, I don't think of it as a second hand; I believe that I am who I am. I'm approaching 30, and I've reached the point where it's kind of tough love for me. I am going to be who I am, and I'm gonna do my best to listen to everyone and ensure that everyone feels included. So, my prior experience has led to that.

Beth: Awesome, thank you for that, Bryan. So, if we can shift the conversation from, you know, the personal to more professional realm. As project managers, part of our job is to help advise clients when developing project teams, creating equitable spaces, and establishing the built environment. What are some ways we in the AEC industry can impact change through our work?

Bryan: This is a tough question to answer because our industry is always gonna impact change. It's very tangible. I think when we're developing project teams, I think it's important to reach out to firms and organizations that have diverse and unique perspectives. I always come back to that term "perspective" because I believe that will lend itself to a greater project, and I don't have the data to follow that up. But, I hope that understanding that it's not just one group of people that should be making all the decisions or a group of people with similar backgrounds. There are just unique circumstances in different cultural backgrounds that lend itself to the built environment. That's a tough question to answer.

Beth: It is. But we're just starting the conversation, so we don't have to have all the answers, right? So, what advice would you give somebody younger than yourself pursuing a career that might be worried about facing similar discrimination?

Bryan: First, I wanna say in the workplace, I don't believe that I've ever faced discrimination. There were times when I was a GC when I did have a project manager who always made sure, as I said before, to protect me. And I never really thought I knew the protection, but I always felt safe. But in terms of younger generations, there was something that happened a few years ago that has left a lasting impact on me. One of my friends, she had a gay friend as well who wanted to interview with our company. And he came out to the project and saw our diverse team; it was two women, a gay man, and a straight man. But this individual realized that on our project, we were just being our complete and utter selves, and we had such a joyful environment. We could be who we were, we were accepted by everyone on the project site, and we got everything done. We had this team that just worked like a machine because we loved one another, and we became great friends. And, to this individual, it left a lasting impact because they left the project, the thought that wow, I never thought that in construction, you would ever see such a diverse group of people. And, they love the fact the company embraced it, that the company allowed us to be who we were, you know, it's interesting, we were kind of like the oddball project with all their personalities. But to this person, it, it resonated with him, and it resonates to me that it doesn't matter what your background is; you should still be able to thrive in any environment, and it starts with leadership. I want younger people who want to come into construction project management to understand that it's just important to be who you are and stay true to yourself.

Beth: Yeah, no matter what, right? You do your best work when you're really good with who you are, right? You're not focused on being worried, but you're able to focus on that work.

Bryan: Right. And you don't feel like you're under the microscope for some reason.

Beth: Yeah. So, if we start turning towards a company level here, how do you think we can bake DEI into MGAC's DNA?

Bryan: Well, first, we're already doing it now. We're having our podcasts where we're having these conversations out in the open. I believe that MGAC has already taken the steps of creating a committee, a DEI committee that addresses the concerns of the employees and addresses or begins to address difficult conversations. I love the fact that we have created a diversity, equity, and inclusion calendar noting the unique holidays, important dates in the year, of course, having these open conversations, a book club. These open conversations begin to change the DNA of a company.

Beth: Yeah. So, if you were establishing a company from the very ground up, what would you do to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion were central to the company's values?

Bryan: That's a tough question. I don't know if any one company has really been successful at that. I am not an expert in talent acquisition. But if I were starting from the ground up, I would, as I've touched upon earlier, I would commit to certain metrics and establish a benchmark in five years of how many people or individuals I want to hire based on unique backgrounds or whatnot. And I think that at least, is going to increase diversity in the workforce. I don't know what those metrics may be, but I think that could be a really good start.

Beth: So, here comes another tough question for you to noodle on. Can you speak to increasing diversity and representation while avoiding tokenization?

Bryan: This is one question that has kind of stumped me. I don't think of diversity and representation, kind of, in this bubble where you can...I can see the root of the question, but we haven't really defined what diversity is in this podcast.

Beth: I mean, I'm hearing very carefully the need to get statistics, right? That can lend to tokenization of individuals because you can put up these marvelous statistics. But is it really who you are as a company? I guess it speaks to your ability to examine your own motives, right? What are your motives behind statistics? I wanna safeguard that we have a very diverse company, but nobody wants to feel tokenized.

Bryan: Yeah, I mean, I certainly don't want to feel tokenized. In terms of statistics, I understand how that helps the conversation in terms of growing diversity. But in terms of tokenization, I just hope that the intention behind creating that work for expanding diversity inclusion is not based on tokenization. It's not based on singling a single group out; it's all about intention, really. It's different from when a company says, you know, we're just gonna grow this for the sake of being diverse. That's not the right approach to this problem. And I would say that that begins with leadership. It's the idea that you have a senior leadership team that embraces everyone's background, everyone's unique perspectives because they understand that they're gonna bring something to the table that's also important, but not just for the sake of being Latino or being gay, you know. That's a different conversation, and that's not the approach that I would go down.

Beth: Yeah. So, for our co-workers who may or may not have personal experience, either through a friend or a colleague, of experiencing discrimination and negative treatment as a result of someone's identity, what advice would you give on how to be an ally? I mean, you've talked a little bit about you always felt protected, and I don't mean to lead you here, but how would you say to someone that has not had your experience or mine as a woman in a male-dominated industry, how could they be an ally?

Bryan: You know, I've been really grateful, you know, I have touched upon this before – I've always had a strong, it's always been women who have created this unique bond with me. And I have to say I always love that bond and the bond between a gay man and a woman. It's a little stereotypical, but historically, I guess, for me, it's always been a woman that's been there to be my ally. And the reason why they have been my best allies is because they're there to understand, there are potential challenges that we face. I think it's also because, as you said, women in construction are also a marginalized group of people within our own field, and they feel it. I think women understand and have helped me understand that you're there to support each other by listening to each other, asking how each other is doing, and always being there to provide support and help. I know, and I want to be an ally; I always want to understand someone's background, understand their story, and try to put myself in their shoes, try to experience what they have experienced, but it really comes through conversation. And, I don't mean to sound cliche when I say put yourself in someone else's shoes, because that's honestly, it's a tough task to do, especially if you're a 60-year-old white man, dealing with a 29, gay, Latino. But really, it just has to come through conversation, having the conversation and listening to one another, and then being comfortable with asking the tough questions. For me, at least I'm an open book. I'm not scared to be vulnerable. I understand that vulnerability could actually be a strength at times. It allows people to open up to you; it allows you to be approached by someone who may have not known that they could speak to you. I think a part of this conversation has to do with vulnerability and also having courage. That's going to help with these conversations.

Beth: Says the man who has had great courage this afternoon. And my friend, I am honored to have been able to speak with you.

Bryan: Thank you so much, Beth.

Beth: Thank you for listening to the inaugural episode of "MGAC Inner Voices." Check back next month for our next episode.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Author, journalist, and historian Carter G. Woodson lobbied strongly for the national recognition of Black stories and perspectives. Woodson believed equality was only possible with the acknowledgement and understanding of a race’s history, and dedicated his life to African American historical research. As a result of Woodson’s efforts, Black History Month was born in 1917.

On this first day of Black History Month, we wanted to highlight one of our clients whose mission aligns with Mr. Woodson’s. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC)</a> is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture.

The museum opened its doors in the Fall of 2016 with the goal of providing an opportunity for those interested in African American culture to explore the history through interactive exhibitions; to help all Americans see how their stories, history, and cultures are shaped and informed by global influences; to examine what it means to be an American, and how American values like resiliency, optimism, and spirituality are embodied by African American history; and to serve as a place of collaboration that reaches well beyond Washington, DC.

We take pride in all of the work we do, but occasionally there is a project that is particularly impactful, one that has far-reaching significance beyond the physical space itself. The NMAAHC was one of those projects. MGAC had the honor of serving as Exhibit Project Coordinator for the fabrication and installation of 12 themed exhibition spaces totaling 100,000 SF. The firm was also a subcontractor consultant and representative for the Exhibit Fabricator. Our primary role was to ensure that exhibit installation was coordinated with on-site construction work, and that overall construction activity did not hinder the Client’s ability to complete their work.

To date, the NMAAHC has collected more than 36,000 artifacts and receives on average nearly 1,500,000 visits each year. In celebration of Black History Month, the museum is hosting new programs, initiatives, and experiences throughout February. <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/celebrating-black-history-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to learn more.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abegarsal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Abraham (Abe) Garcia</strong></a>, Senior Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Hi Abe, welcome to the blog! Tell us what you do at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Abe Garcia (AG): </strong>I’m a Senior Project Manager, which means managing a project from inception to completion and close-out activity. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/project-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Management</a> includes hiring all the right consultants, vendors, and contractors along the way. It’s being the eyes and ears of the client throughout the life of the project. All clients are different—some are more involved than others—so gauging that and executing their needs accordingly is a big piece of the job.

<strong><b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #f22e00;"><strong>MGAC:</strong> </span></span></b>So truly acting as an extension of the client?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Exactly. The thought is to be a seamless part of their team, even if it’s on a temporary basis. You’re helping them get through the different stages of the project, which, for the most part, they aren’t experts on. That’s why they hire MGAC.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how long have you been on board at MGAC?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I started in December 2019. But it feels like I've been here a lifetime—in a good way! It’s been great being a part of the firm and I’m looking forward to years and years of working here in the LA office.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s great to hear! Has Los Angeles always been home?</strong>

<strong>AG:</strong> I’ve been in LA most of my life. I was born in Zapopan, Mexico, but pretty much raised in LA. I’ve moved around a bit—I was in the Bay Area for a job for about two years—but came back here as soon as I could. This is home.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What’s the construction landscape like in LA right now? Any major trends? </strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>There’s a continuous growth of population in Los Angeles, so there’s a lot of residential, multi-family development right now. Tech has also been big over the last few years. Tech companies are migrating from the Bay Area down to LA because of the cost-of-living difference. Some are even headquartering in LA. Downtown development was quickly growing over the last few years, but that seems to have slowed down a bit. That pace of development really did a lot to bring-up Downtown LA. When I was younger, you wouldn’t really go there for good restaurants or to go out for the night. But that quickly changed with all the recent development.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Interesting! So, what led you to MGAC?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I was working as a Senior Project Manager in the LA area, and I liked the fact that MGAC has a lot of good functions like <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/cost-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Management</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/ff-e-procurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FF&amp;E Procurement</a>, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/relocation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relocation Management</a>. I liked that we have that all in-house. We can either offer those services individually or as a whole, depending on what the client needs.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Bet that makes your job as a project manager a little easier!</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It does, especially on the cost side. Clients and others are always asking “If I wanted to do X, what would that cost me?” Or, “If I wanted to delete this, or add that, about how much would that cost?” Having done this for a number of years, I might already have that information for a lot of those questions. But when I don’t, or when my information is outdated, that’s where our cost team comes in. MGAC’s relocation management service is another I look to often. When we have a client who wants to bring on a move consultant, or is just looking to understand the process, it’s easy for us to tap the knowledge of our team members.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What a great resource to have at your fingertips.</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Definitely. Just knowing that expertise exists in-house is great for our clients. It makes the job easier for us and for the client as they can look to one partner for both of those tasks, in addition to project management. This also helps give us an edge in landing new opportunities. That’s actually how MGAC landed the project I’m working with now, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/nfl-media-headquarters/223">NFL Media's new headquarters</a> in Inglewood, CA. The cost estimating team did a couple of estimates for them, and they knew MGAC also specialized in project management and asked to start a conversation.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Nice! Tell us more about the work you’re doing. </strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>NFL Media has grown out of their current studios and needs a bigger space with larger studios and more versatility. They need flexibility built-in, with space for multiple shows within the same studio. They're building, from a technical perspective, a state-of-the-art broadcast system that’s really unique. That component, I would say, is different from a typical project that I manage. For the most part, when you’re working on corporate interiors, you’re building conference rooms, a laboratory, and file and document rooms. Every client is different. But with this one, we’re not only building their offices and conference rooms, but also the studio portion with all the technical infrastructure that makes those studios work. It’s been a great challenge. Part of the project is my “regular project” that I manage. And then, there is this other portion that’s not entirely new—I’ve managed studio build-outs in the past—but the technology is on the newer side. It's been great learning from other team members who understand all that and know 100 percent what the goal is, and what we’re striving for.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Sounds like a great challenge!  </strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Absolutely. The project has been very rewarding in that sense. It’s been great working with the whole team as we come together and try to manage everything, so it comes together under common goals and a common schedule. That’s been a challenge, merging all of these elements and activities into a common schedule. That’s been my task. And, it’s actively changing. With construction, when you’re managing a schedule, it’s a week-by-week, if not a day-by-day, process. And on top of that, there are four different phases in terms of delivering the project. But seeing all of the team members coming together—MGAC, the architect, the contractor, and great representation on the client’s side—to work under one umbrella has been really rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So, we’re guessing you probably didn’t always plan to be a project manager when you were a kid. </strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Not exactly!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It probably changed a million times! I loved sports growing up. I started with soccer, being born in Mexico. Then I took a liking to American football when I came to the U.S. I had dreams of making it big! But once those dreams started to come crashing down and I realized that I certainly didn’t have the size or speed to do anything professionally, I thought about doing something with law or government. That was my strong suit coming out of high school. Government, history, that sort of thing. But that changed when I was in college, and I ultimately got my degree in civil engineering. That led me to the project management world. So, it changed from being a professional athlete, to being a lawyer, to what I do now. And I feel so lucky and thankful to have stumbled upon this work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So even though you wouldn’t have expected you’d be doing this, what would that kid think about your current job today?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I think about that often. I used to want to play sports professionally for many reasons, but that didn’t pan out. But, here I am <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-on-the-move-nfl-media-headquarters/">working with NFL Media</a>, helping them build their new studios. That’s very rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Earlier, you mentioned the challenges you’ve faced working on that project. What would you say are some of the biggest lessons you’ve learned during your time with MGAC?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Managing your time even more effectively than before. And I thought I was pretty efficient coming into this assignment! But the project demands that you’re that much more efficient. There’s so much going on at any given time, if you don’t manage your time accordingly and properly, you’re going to feel overwhelmed, especially in the beginning. Because there’s so much to do. It continues to be a challenge, but we created some organization around that when we were first brought on to manage everything more effectively. We set up calls and meetings with different team members, created priority lists, and continue to challenge the team to prioritize items. That’s the only way we can get through a project at this size and scale.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And what about the company has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It’s been the people. From when I first joined in December 2019 and almost immediately going to the holiday party. I had a little anxiety to see what the folks were all about. Are they going to welcome me in? Are they even going to talk to me? Whenever you join anything new, there are those insecurities. But immediately, I walked into the company meeting before the party and a number of different folks already knew my name and who I was. That was great. And hearing <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42">Mark Anderson</a> during that meeting; hearing his perspective and introduction to the meeting, to this day has had a lasting impact. Because I believe it starts from the top. The way a company is run, the integrity of the company, what the company is about, always starts at the very top. And then there was the party part. We’re all talking, and there was some dancing going on. And it was as if I'd known these people for years and years.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s great. So far, what have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I’ve been raised to give back. Always asking, “What can I do to help and make an impact for others?” Going back to when I was thinking about being a lawyer, maybe getting into politics, it was me wanting to make an impact on people in a positive way. That’s one aspect about MGAC that has been the most rewarding. MGAC cares about giving back to the communities that we’re located in. This pandemic has brought out the best in people—the worst in some. But it’s definitely brought out the best in MGAC. This moment gives even more perspective to the lasting impact of our work in communities.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I’m really excited about the ways we’re making this happen through the project I’m currently working on. Sometimes that is big-picture, and sometimes it’s about the little things. For instance, thanks to our client, we work with local restaurants that are struggling during this pandemic to bring breakfast or lunch to the crew. That also helps the morale of the workers on the site, who themselves are working through this crisis.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Wow, what a gesture!</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It really is. And more broadly, I’m excited about being a part of what I think is the start of something great for the local community, and, in broader terms, for LA. I think people will see our project as one of the outstanding developments in the area. Even being a small portion of that is great. I hope to continue that momentum moving forward. When we help a company establish their office or headquarters in greater LA, when we help them grow, it means they can hire more people—ultimately creating more employment opportunities for the area.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So true. Needless to say, all of that is keeping you pretty busy these days. What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Definitely my family. We have three girls, Reese, Amelia, and Aleia. We also have two puppies. It’s a full house. There’s a lot of energy. I have to mute myself quite a bit in meetings these days! But they all give me energy and it’s great to see my kids in such a fun stage of their lives

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Once the computer gets shut down, spending time with the family is my favorite way to wind down. Play with the girls, play with the puppies. Try to forget a little bit about work and switch over to home life. It’s all about balance. There are days where there is a lot going on with the project, and I have to make it a point to step away from the computer and be with my family at the end of the day. Even before the pandemic, that was my favorite way to wind down.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>What helps me start the day is what I do at the end of the previous day. I have a notebook and I write down everything that is essential to helping me get through the next day. Looking at those notes, coffee in hand, and getting through the first e-mails that come through, that’s what helps get the wheels in motion for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I’d have to say <em>Things Fall Apart. </em>I read it in college, and then again, a few years after graduating. What stayed with me from the book is how people deal with change, especially when trying to keep traditions intact. It’s a tug-of-war that many works of art have tried to portray in different ways and this book does a great job taking the reader through that struggle, the consequences, and the outcomes (which, unfortunately, are not always positive).

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It comes from Benito Juárez, the first indigenous president of Mexico: “Entre los individuos, como entre las naciones, el respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz.” Roughly translated to English, it’s “Among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace.”

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s a great one. Okay, now it’s time for some rapid-fire questions. We’ll ask a question, and you tell us the first answer that comes to mind. Sound good? </strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Absolutely!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Helping clients deliver great projects.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What can't you leave home without?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>Cell phone. And not just for work purposes; I think for a lot of us, so much of our lives are on it. It’s how we stay connected to others. I think I could even leave my wallet at home and not necessarily miss it!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>On my desk, I have this miniature replica of an indigenous mask from Mexico. I can’t even remember where I bought it, but I think of it as my lucky charm. I had it on my desk before the pandemic, and it’s one of the only things I brought when we started working from home.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What do you miss most from work before the pandemic?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>If I’m in the office, saying goodbye and chatting with those folks who are still around. You’ll have a conversation that gets really interesting and ends up pushing your leave time by 30 minutes. I love those impromptu chats. That’s when you really get to know people.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I don’t think that many people know I play drums. I’ve been drumming away for most of my life. It’s a hobby that helps me relax and get energy out.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to workday lunch?</strong>

<strong>AG:</strong> I practice intermittent fasting, so I don’t eat anything until 11 or 12. That means it’s breakfast for lunch. I alternate between cereal and eggs in some form—it might be in a sandwich, with bacon, or in a burrito.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>It’s between Messages, which I use for people with iPhones, and WhatsApp. That’s how I communicate with my extended family, who mostly have Androids.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your biggest work goal for 2021?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>This project. To deliver it around mid-year—that’s when the biggest portion is due. It’s the most complex project I’ve worked on. So, to deliver it on time and within budget, even after all the COVID-19 issues that we’ve had to deal with on-site, is going to be very rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>AG: </strong>I love what I do, so I want to continue this path I’m on. I hope the projects continue to be challenging and complex—and rewarding, as a result. By five years, that’s the perfect time frame for moving up the next steps of this career path: maybe a Vice President position at MGAC!

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, Dave Hicks gives us a tour of the Van Ness Residences in Los Angeles, CA.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi. My name's Dave Hicks and I'm a Project Manager with MGAC. Let's get moving!</em>

<em>The Van Ness Residence project consists of 12 individual townhouses. Each townhouse has four levels with a rooftop deck. Each townhouse is approximately 2,600 SF in total. We were engaged by Bixby Ridge Gap to provide project management and construction management services. At the time of our appointment, the project had 80% of its steel modular frame installed and the first level of timber framing was complete. We appointed a new general contractor. All the existing completed work was surveyed to confirm its installation was correct. Existing work that was identified as incorrect was swiftly removed and corrected. The Van Ness Residence's project commenced in January of 2019 and it is due for completion at the conclusion of February 2021.</em>

<em>So I hope you've enjoyed seeing what we're up to here at the Van Ness Residence project. Follow MGAC to see our next move!</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit our work on Discovery Channel Stores.</em>
<h4><strong>The Mission </strong></h4>
Back in 1997 when the world was abuzz over experience-based retail, Discovery Channel set out to build a 30,000-square-foot flagship store in Washington, DC’s MCI Center (now <a href="https://www.capitalonearena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital One Arena</a>). The project aimed to bring the cable TV brand to life, and was just the first in a series of retail outposts that MGAC would help Discovery Channel execute across the country over the following decade.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3903" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/D020_N3.jpg" alt="" width="1913" height="1556" />
<h4><strong>The Challenges</strong></h4>
Nicknamed “Hollywood on the Potomac,” the flagship store was a <a href="https://www.nreionline.com/mag/discovery-channel-retail-unveils-flagship-store-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gargantuan production</a>. Our tasks included heading to the Black Hills of South Dakota to buy, transport, and then assemble a life-size skeleton cast of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. There was an egg-shaped elevator with armadillo “scales.” A 36-screen, 270-degree high-def movie theater broadcasting the company's cable channel programming. Nothing was spared in the production of this store. Discovery Channel’s wishlist even took MGAC Founder and President <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a> across the country to purchase the front end of a B25 bomber from a former member of Hells Angels in Chino, CA. Anderson drove it back on a truck to DC, where the team had its nose art repainted and hung on a wall in the store.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3907" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DC_2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" />
<h4><strong>The Significance</strong></h4>
Just our second client, Discovery Channel truly set the stage for the firm. In fact, MGAC was so new, we didn’t even have business cards when we interviewed for the job. But we landed the project nonetheless, in part thanks to our already-established reputation for local construction expertise. At the time, the Discovery Channel flagship store was one of the most talked-about projects in DC. Landing it right out the gate put our firm on the map.

MGAC’s relationship with Discovery Channel truly took off when the firm was tapped to also manage the roll-out of <strong>173 additional store locations</strong> across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom over a 10-year period. While there was no life-sized T-Rex involved, the task was still impressive. Delivering each on a 10-week construction cycle, we initiated and managed an architectural design competition; established yearly store development budgets, opening schedules, and program documents; administered all store competitive bidding; reviewed architectural invoices; and negotiated landlord interaction. Those stores’ international spread is another major element that distinguishes this project in MGAC’s history. From the outset, we were never just a DC firm.
<h4><strong>The Legacy</strong></h4>
In a word, the lasting impact of this project has been relationships. It built connections that have continued to pay dividends for our firm 25 years later. Anderson describes it as “lighting the end of the fuse.” Project partners went on to refer some of our superstar staff members to MGAC, and the work also opened the door to some of our favorite future projects. Plus, for the first time, we realized there was no limit to the “what ifs” we could make a reality. If our team could move a T-Rex skeleton halfway across the country—what couldn’t we do?]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, and welcome to "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. We want to preface this podcast by letting you know that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wanna share our stories and discuss how, together, we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. My name is Bryan Gamez. I'm a Project Manager at MGAC, working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today, we will be speaking with Brandey McDonald, and it is my honor to introduce her. Brandey?

Brandey: My name is Brandey McDonald, and I am a Project Manager with MGAC. I work out of Washington, D.C. where I'm based, and I've been with MGAC for over two years. I've actually been in the construction industry for now 12 years and counting and wonderfully counting. And just so you know, I am black and unapologetically black. 

Bryan: We love that, Brandey. We love that.

Brandey: Yeah.

Bryan: I am so happy to have you on this podcast. I am so interested to hear about your experiences. I've been in the construction industry for about five years. I've only met a handful of black women, and I love that you're so empowered and I love your energy.

Brandey: Thanks.

Bryan: I wanna begin our conversation by asking you, how has your identity affected you in professional spaces? And are there challenges that you've faced in your career because of your identity?

Brandey: So, you know, I would say that, Bryan, you know, more so than anything, I've been really, really lucky. I haven't faced a lot of challenges in my career in regard to my identity. I don't think I have, let me just say that. Let me just be very honest. When I listen to others who are like me and who are from the African American community, I don't have the same stories as they do, you know, those who have encountered a lot of racism or anything else. I don't have a lot of stories. I do have stories, but I don't have a lot of stories. And so, I would say that more than anything, what has affected me in my professional space is, I'll be honest, being a black woman in the construction industry or just being a black woman, period, just being a professional black woman, we have to be very careful.

Black women are very strong. We have the reputation of being very strong. And then you add the construction industry on top of it or a woman that sits in the construction industry and you've gotta add a little bit more strength to that person. So, we have to be careful more than anything else to make sure that we don't become deemed as the angry black woman walking around. The way that we would react in some ways, some people would look at us as being aggressive. I look at Michelle Obama and how people just really talked about her when she came out, and she just voiced her opinions, and she wasn't quiet, and she was very knowledgeable, and she was very educated, and it was very intimidating for people when they deemed her the person who was an angry black woman. And so, I think that more than anything we as black women in the industry – that's the one thing that I would say how my ethnicity really affects me more than anything that I might have to go a little bit easier or switch up the way that I would say something to someone because of maybe my dialect or because of the way, you know, how my energy is or anything else. Someone might think that I might be being aggressive when I'm actually not being aggressive. I'm just being who I am.

And so, I would say that that's, you know, that's one thing that has really affected me as far as my identity as being a black woman in this industry, that I'm always conscious of the fact that, "Okay, Brandey, don't go overboard. Don't use your hands, don't make a face, or don't push your neck," because somebody might say, "Oh, she's angry. She's an angry black woman."

Bryan: You know, Brandey, I'm not a black woman, but I am gay and Latino and I'm also proud of my identity. So, what you're saying right now resonates with me. You're mindful of your actions, your words, and you almost seem to accommodate people around the table.

Brandey: Yeah.

Bryan: And as you say that that's just part of our experiences, but I'm happy that you are empowered to speak your own voice. You are going to say it how it is.

Brandey: Yeah. Definitely, I would say that those that I work with, any of my colleagues that are in MGAC with me, there are times, definitely, when I've been sitting next to someone and perhaps a contractor says something wrong, and I have to say what I have to say and the way that I say it... And I had a colleague say, "Oh, boy. There she goes. Angry black woman. There she goes." And I have to laugh about it. And I'm like, "I'm not angry. I'm just being assertive. I'm just asserting myself.”

Bryan: On the topic of the concept of an angry black woman, do you think that that concept continues to affect you today in the workplace on construction sites because you have referenced it just now?

Brandey: Yeah. I will not lie. You know, I probably have a bit of a reputation, not necessarily for being the angry black woman, but for being someone, again, who speaks my mind, and who's very direct, and basically gets the job done. And a lot of times when people see women who are like that and who have no problem voicing what's on their mind, you know, within a professional reason, of course, I think that most people kinda say, "Oh, okay. Well, she's different from the rest," or "Wow." I've been labeled aggressive. I have. I will tell you that, Bryan. I'll be very honest. I've had a client call me aggressive. I did find that out. And I just looked and said, "Okay, I'd rather be aggressive than not be aggressive and not get any work done."

It is shameful that I do have to taper things from time to time just because of who I am as a black woman, as a woman in general, that makes me be the way that I am. It carries with us as black women. I will tell you whenever I see another black woman in this particular industry, which again, as you said, there are just not very many of us. There are quite a number that sit on the contracting side, but actually, to be a part of this world here on the A/C side, you know, you really just don't see a lot of us. And so, I know for a fact when I do see a woman on this side of the business, she's gotta be one tough cookie, one tough cookie.

Bryan: I'm really happy that you are sitting on this side of the table.

Brandey: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Bryan: Have you ever had to adapt who you are as a person in the workplace and what has motivated that and how has that affected you?

Brandey: So, I will say, as I said before, you know, of course, I've had to adapt, whether it was my own dialect, or my mannerisms, or anything else because, again, you know, black women are colorful. We do certain things and we move certain ways that some people wouldn't normally really accept that in a professional environment. But I will say another thing that is really prominent, you know, as far as what has affected me, myself, and I know others is the way that we wear our hair. Most people don't really think about that. I have my funky hairstyle that's really like a frohawk. This industry is a lot more lenient. You know, Bryan, before I came into the construction industry, I was in banking and municipal finance. At that time, my hair was very straight and had what we call creamy crack. I hate to say that, but it was, you know, the perm. That's what we call it. And my hair was very straight and it was to my shoulders and even prior to me moving into the construction industry, my hair, even at a natural state, it was still straightened. When I transferred out of the finance world, I know I was able to really find myself and feel more comfortable because on this side of the fence, I don't have to wear a suit every day and I didn't have to wear pantyhose. You know, at the time, I was wearing pantyhose, and high heels, and suits when I was a banker because I was a commercial banker and also in municipal finance where, you know, of course, you're dealing with institutional clients.

And so, when I came onto this side of the fence, it was much different and it was a much more relaxed atmosphere. And I finally was able to breathe and say, 'Okay." And at that time when I did transfer over to construction, that's when the natural look was really starting to come about. And so, for me, it was really a sigh of relief that I could actually wear my hair at a natural state, and now nobody says anything to me about my hair and my funky hairstyle or my funky glasses that I wanna wear or anything else because, again, it's just construction. And, of course, I do remain professional at all times, but again, I think that's one thing that we, as black women have had to deal with over the course of time of, "Should I put a wig on? I'm going on an interview," or "I'm going in front of a client. Maybe I should put a wig on and something that's more straight where they're not intimidated." I do work in public work and I just so happen to be lucky that my clients are, you know, they look like me, a number of them look like me. And so they're not going to judge me, but if I were to be on the federal side perhaps and I were dealing with the, you know, with the Department of Defense, one might feel a little bit different because of my natural hairstyle. And so that's something that we have to think about before going in front of clients in this industry.

Bryan: I have to say that I'm speaking to Brandey right now and I can see her and her hairstyle is amazing. I would say you are looking flawless.

Brandey: Thank you.

Bryan: And I love your glasses.

Brandey: Thanks.

Bryan: So, I'm happy that you're able to feel comfortable in your own skin now. I had a black roommate and she would go through hours of straightening her hair and she would say, "This is just something that I wish I didn't have to deal with." And now, she's feeling her natural self and she works actually in the Senate here in California. And I love that she is embracing that aspect of herself and for yourself as well, Brandey, I think that's an important topic to talk about and also have people be aware that that's part of your DNA and this is how you're expressing yourself. I love your hair; I love your look, and I'm happy that you're so confident in it, as you should be.

Brandey: Thanks. I appreciate that. Yeah. It's definitely been difficult, and I have seen other friends go through it. I've seen those walk into the office with braids in their hair and people look at them and say, "Oh, you got your hair...", you know, or just whatever else. And I think that people don't really realize that we as black women, you know, our hair... We're taught to think that our hair is our crown because that's what we were taught as little girls and that it depends upon what generation we come from. My mother really believes that her hair is her crown. I'm trying to get my mother to go natural. She won't even go. It's a confidence thing for us. And so, I need people to really understand when you see a black woman and you like her hair, don't touch her hair. Don't ask, "Oh, can I touch your hair? Can I do...?" It's just not right. And I think that people need to understand that we do deal with our levels of insecurity from time to time with our hair. There's a lot of us that are still dealing with it. I'm not dealing with it. I'm very proud of the way that my hair is. I've had people say, "Wow, that's a really funky hairstyle." And I said, "You know what? That's right and I love it." But there's not a lot of people who are like me, who would actually feel that way. So, we just need to be more people to understand that.

Bryan: Do you have any advice for women out there who are still struggling with that aspect, especially within the construction industry, AEC industry as well?

Brandey: Yeah. I would definitely say just be yourself. This industry is much different. This is not banking. One can actually be themselves. I had a friend who mentioned to me that her daughter was actually going through a bit of...she's an architect and people in the firm that she worked for would criticize her a bit or pick on her because she was very fashionable. And I just thought to myself, "She's in architecture. Architects are artists. Why would she not be able to express who she is from an artistic perspective of how she dresses, how she wears her hair?" And from what I understand, there were individuals that did comment on her hair because she often times went from braids to extensions and even to short. And so, I would say more than anything own your style, own who you are as a person. The more confident that you are as an individual, the more that people are gonna be able to just understand, "Don't say that to that person because it's not gonna phase that person at all." I think that most people, when they have comments like that, that's their own insecurities that they're dealing with.

Bryan: That's great advice. I think that that will resonate with a lot of people. That brings us into our next question. What is the greater big picture impact of this treatment on people's image in the workplace and how do you think that we can move past this?

Brandey: I think that the more that we educate individuals on it, for instance, if a black woman is dealing with somebody else's insecurities and they're mentioning to them about their hair, or their style, or anything else, I think that that black woman should actually stand up for herself and actually ask that person, "I'm sorry, does my hair bother you?" You know, be confident and own what you decide to do. I think that's the only way and to also to be able to educate individuals and say, "You know, that's not really appropriate." It's not okay to reach out and touch my hair because you think it looks funky, or it's curly, or whatever else. It's not okay to ask me to touch my hair. It's not okay for you to make comments about my hair. Would you like me to make comments about yours?" I'm sorry. That's me, Bryan. That's what I would say.

Bryan: But you make a good point, Brandey. I think a lot of people, especially in marginalized groups have thought, "You know, do I speak up in this instance? Is it okay to ask, you know, is there a problem?" And I've known that I found myself, you know, being a little quiet at those moments because I also think of myself as colorful. I use hand motions and whatnot. And so, you bring up a good point. Be confident in knowing that you should ask the questions, "Is there an issue? Is there a problem?" Because at that point, you're going to educate someone who may have not known or may have just been ignorant to the idea.

Brandey: Absolutely. Yeah. I think education is key more than anything.

Bryan: I agree. So, I wanna move into the second part of our conversations about the advantages of diversity. Why is diversity, equity, and inclusion important in the workplace and what value does it add?

Brandey: I would say, you know, diversity and inclusion is very, you know, it's advantageous to the workplace and it brings so many unique cultural experiences to the workplace. And that's what makes the world go round. You have to look at things from different perspectives at all times. How one particular culture would approach something would be different from the way another culture would approach things. It's not just all one-sided. Life, in general, is just not all one-sided. And we do have to understand the sensitivity that those of us who come from backgrounds of color, our experiences that we have actually gone through, or the things that we have to endure. You, Bryan, you're from the Latino culture. You might have relatives that have been affected by what has happened to us in the last four years or the things that we've seen in the last four years, the horrific events that we've seen that has happened to that particular community. And myself included, you know, in my community with the George Floyd situation and how individuals in my family have been affected. I have a brother that is a darker complexion than me. My mom is a very dark skin woman and how she may have, at a younger stage in life, encountered things that never had to encounter as a young woman. But these are the things that we bring to our everyday lives, and these are things that everybody should understand and we should at least have empathy to understanding what those other individuals from other cultures have been through.

Bryan: Absolutely. I think that bringing diversity into the workplace provides another level of perspective to our one, our company culture, and also across the building spectrum. And you touched upon something that I kinda wanna expand on. The past four years, as you said, have been difficult for Mexican Americans, Latino Americans, but also Black Americans. Do you wanna touch upon how George Floyd and Black Lives Matter has affected you in the workplace or has made you feel empowered? Last year, 2020, was a great year for activists to get out there. We are going to be around and we're gonna impact for change. I would be interested in your thoughts.

Brandey: So, the one thing that I saw that came out of the whole entire George Floyd situation, it was almost like an awakening. Although, you know, black folks have been encountering things like this for years and we've been seeing it from as simple as, you know, going into... I dunno, let's say, a Saks Fifth Avenue and a woman approaching me looking at me, you know, whatever else because I am black and me looking at her like, "Are you kidding?" I mean, realistically to even the George Floyd situation or so many others, Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, and those who have actually been shot down and killed, this has been an awakening. And I think it's been an awakening for so many Americans, where so many Americans have actually been able to see things through our eyes and understand what has been happening this whole time. And I think more than anything else, it has given me more confidence to speak out in regards to my culture and to speak more proudly about my culture.

Just like I said, I'm unapologetically black. I always have been unapologetically black, but I'm even more unapologetically black now because of everything that has happened. And I say that because I'm looking at so many different corporations who have taken the opportunity, who have said, "Oh, my, this is a problem." So many owners, even like Mark our own owner, who has actually said, "You know, this is a problem and we need to do more," and hearing Stephanie even from our HR side actually say, "Wow, we took a look around and, Brandey, we realized we had no people of color at the top," and I was like, "Oh, really? Did you think that?" because I've been saying that to myself. But when she said it, I was like, "Oh, yeah. You're right. Do something about it." And for me, I'm very proud of this time because it has given us a lot more courage. We are more confident speaking about the things that we really want to see here in the black community. When you have leadership in various ways, allowing black folks to actually decrease the racial wealth gap that we have here, the fact that there's so much of that going on, so many people dealing with the racial inequities, and we even heard President Biden speak about it just yesterday, this is a great time for black people. And I've said it to friends who own their own businesses and those who are looking to climb the ladder. This is the time like no other. Corporations are looking to put people like us in places and you better take advantage of it.

Bryan: Absolutely. How would you say that your identity has made you this strong asset for your team?

Brandey: I say more than anything, it's that whole entire strong black woman thing. I was raised by my parents obviously, but my mom is one strong black woman and she definitely instilled that in me. And I love to implement that into my role as a project manager and as one who has to oversee so many people. Women in our ability to have a bit of empathy in a situation, I think that that is also very beneficial for our teams at times in this line of business that we are so busy and people are so busy oftentimes fighting one another. We sit on the owner's side, you know, our owners' representatives. We have to fight for our owners, and we have to go up against the general contractor from time to time. And my general contractor, my project manager actually said to me, she said, "Brandey, this is the first time that I felt really respected on this project."

Bryan: That's amazing.

Brandey: Yeah. And that was because even though we may go at it like cats and dogs from time to time behind the scenes, the fact is at the end of the day, I can still look at her and say, "You know what? I apologize if I made you feel this way. And if I made you feel this way, this is because this is how I was feeling about the situation." And we can move forward with respecting one another and saying, "Okay, we can agree to disagree and keep moving things forward." Contract speaks for itself anyway. And there's been a level of respect between her and I. And I think that's what men sometimes miss in this industry is the level of empathy that women often bring. It's needed. 

Bryan: I agree with you. I would say that in my experience, just as you've highlighted right now, my strongest relationships have been with female project managers, and they provide a level of empathy that men do not, and they also will take the time to really explain a situation to you if you have questions that... Also, women are effective communicators.

Brandey: And some people say that we over-communicate, but I would rather be one who over-communicates than not to and have people confused because when there's confusion then there's frustration. Our jobs are hard enough as is on a daily basis. We don't need to create frustration on our projects. We need to be able to say what we need to say, you know, and get it done and just keep it moving.

Bryan: Agreed.

Brandey: And I think that men oftentimes feel that we as women become too emotional. That is a lot of times what I say to those that I mentor. Make sure that you don't become too emotional in this business being a woman because unfortunately, you know, men will use that to your disadvantage. That's something that we oftentimes, we have to adjust with. But I think that again, that empathy and also the fact that we overexplain at times really does help.

Bryan: I think that I've experienced myself that sometimes men are more emotional or more of a diva in the workplace, especially general contractors. And I've found myself sometimes saying, "Why is this general contractor, this man being more of a diva than me?" And I think to myself, "It's just the nature of the business." And you're right. I think you don't have to be emotional to be empathetic, right?

Brandey: Yeah.

Bryan: I think that they're different. And I think you really did hit the nail on the head on that one as well.

Brandey: Yeah. I will tell you I've had my bit of experiences with men who have been very emotional, you know, at times, especially when you catch that contractor maybe not as far as with their costs or whatever, with those change orders and you comb through them with a fine-tooth comb and they...you know, you got some who just get in their feelings about stuff. I've had it happen before. I've had had it where people have called management on me or whatever else, and ultimately, it didn't end up in their favor just because of it, but they became very emotional behind it. And the whole time, I didn't become emotional. I just let everything speak for itself. And you're right. Men do get really emotional at times.

Bryan: So, segueing from that conversation, I want to begin to speak to you about clients and the industry as a whole. As project managers, part of our job is to help advise clients on developing project teams, creating equitable spaces, and establishing the built environment. What are some ways we, in the AEC industry, can impact change through our work?

Brandey: I've been very lucky because my primary client right now, it actually has diverse people at the top. There's people that look like me, quite frankly, that sit at the top of the organization and in leadership positions. And that just so happens to happen in the municipal market truly. That's where we do see a lot of people of color. I tend to be very lucky in that environment because of the leadership that sits at the top. That leadership is very dedicated to creating a diverse environment among their consultants. And so there might be times when, if they're looking for a new consultant from MGAC or even from another firm, that leadership might say, "I really would like to have a woman sit on my team this time," or "Can we find some diversity because we're starting to tip the scale a bit here and we'd like to even out the scale a little bit?" Not to say that that person likes women more, but that person is saying, "We're trying to balance this out." And they're recognizing that there is a requirement or there's a need, not necessarily a requirement, but there's a need for diversity. And I think it is good for us as a whole, as MGAC that we start to actually learn and teach our own colleagues here at MGAC the understanding of diversity and the need for it, not just here, but also too on projects.

Bryan: Absolutely. And I think that we're beginning that conversation now.

Brandey: Yeah.

Bryan: What measures can we take to, you know, expand that conversation with clients who seem uncomfortable with diversity?

Brandey: I think that education is key. I will say this, and I'll be very honest with you. The construction industry has been overtly racist. It really has been. You know, I've been in this industry, just like I said, for 12 years and I encountered racism the moment that I hit the door. I did. I had people who told me I didn't belong in this line of business because I was in elevators and I had people who told me, I shouldn't be in division 14, which is elevators, literally.

Bryan: I'm sorry.

Brandey: Oh, no. It was fine. When that person said that, I said, "Oh, okay. I'll see you at the next pre-bid." Anyway, the fact is I think that from time to time, we do have to let our clients know that this is the way that things are actually going. We do have clients from time to time that if there is public money involved in their particular project, they might be mandated to include more diversity on their projects and they don't want to because it may cost them more money. I think where we come in and especially those of us who are of a diverse nature, that's when we have to come in and create a teachable moment and become educators at that moment as to why, that it's beneficial for our clients to, you know, use diverse contractors to include that, you know, just whatever the case may be. They oftentimes need to be educated. And I think that's what we should do for those who feel uncomfortable.

Bryan: This quote just popped into my head by Maya Angelou. "When you learn, you teach." And I think this is a great example of manifesting that into the world.

Brandey: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Bryan: What advice would you give to young people pursuing AEC careers and are worried about facing discrimination? As you said, you thought that it could be a tough environment.

Brandey: So, I think I would say number one, that young people today have it very good, and we have to give them all of the accolades for allowing so many industries to shift towards diversity and inclusion, not only the whole entire issue with George Floyd and things that we've seen that have happened to Latinos over the past four years, but this was happening prior to that, prior to the previous administration coming in. That particular generation, we see things really starting to formulate and be different here in the U.S. or throughout the world. When you see commercials with mixed couples or interracial couples and things of that sort when before when we saw interracial couples in commercials, you had people complaining and boycotting those products or those companies. But I would say to younger industry, because they do have it so much easier now, to never allow someone to try to take that away from them. That is something that no one can take away from them. They can't take their education, nor can they take the fact that they are of a diverse culture. And I would say wear it proudly. Don't ever let somebody make you feel less than because you are a person of color. Always hold your head high and always keep it moving.

Bryan: Brandey, that tugs at my heartstrings. I would have to say that I'm a millennial. I'm approaching 30 and I think hearing that, it's empowering to me, but I'm sure anyone else who is in college and seeing all of this activity in our country, unrest in our country, I want them to know that that they should be unapologetically themselves. You don't need to accommodate anyone else because they're uncomfortable.

Brandey: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Bryan: What would a more diverse AEC industry look like and what do you think in 10 years time, our industry will look like?

Brandey: Oh, boy. So, our industry, just like I said, it's been an overtly racist industry. I think that it will move slower than the other industries, but it is moving and I'm very happy to see that. It's been a big move even since when I started 12 years ago in this industry, it's been a large move, but I do believe that down the line, we will start to see more faces of color, more women in more executive and C-suite level positions. And that, in turn, will also, too, create a chance for more individuals to rise up the ladder. The problem is right now that many in this industry, we don't see a lot of color and we don't see a lot of women or even those from the LGBT community, we don't see that in levels of leadership. And when you put those diverse individuals who support their own in levels of leadership because I'm not talking about somebody just putting them there. I know there was a question about tokenization. We're not talking about the tokens. We're talking about individuals who really, really support their own. Women who want to do business with other women or who want to see other women. More gay Latino men who want to see more gay Latino men. More black women who want to see more black women or more black men who want to see more black men or women. The fact is at the end of the day, we have to put those individuals in charge who will actually sponsor individuals like you or myself to climb the corporate ladder in order to create diverse leadership across the board in the industry.

Bryan: This is a perfect segue into our next round of topics regarding companies. How do you think that we can continue to bake diversity into our DNA? You talk about filling C-suite positions, which I agree with. And maybe could you touch upon if you were to begin a company from the ground up, what would you do to ensure diversity was central to the company's values?

Brandey: So, I'll tell you, Bryan, I was a business owner, just like I said before or maybe I didn't. I'm sorry if I didn't. But I was a business owner before.

Bryan: I didn't know that. I don't think you did.

Brandey: I'm sorry, yes. I should have said that. That's what got me into the...

Bryan: I know you were a commercial banker.

Brandey: Yeah, yeah, right. I did say that. And after I left commercial banking, I actually moved into construction via Clark Construction, an executive from Clark Construction who approached me and said that we need more black women in positions and leadership roles. So, he was like a sponsor that said...he went out and he found black women to become owners in construction firms. But I would say that having been a business owner, the one thing that I did do was I made sure that those that were at the head and those that were in leadership positions were people of color. And that way, I was able to go out and find other people of color to come on board as well. So, when I found the mechanic because I was in the elevator industry... I swear when I see an elevator guy in my building, he's black, I'm, "Oh, my God, who do you work for?" Because they're just so far and few between. The fact is when...it made it easier for me to be able to attract or have people of color wanna come and work for me because I was a woman and a person of color. And so, for me, I know if I started another company again at some point in time, I would actually do the same thing and I would still keep people of color at the head because I want the talent to come and to understand that they're gonna be understood. When they're there at my company, they're gonna be supported

Bryan: And that visibility at the top is key. Those who are there are going to be individuals who really do genuinely support the people below them. And that's I think what people want more of.

Brandey: Yeah. I will tell you that that's one thing that I feel that we really do need to have more. At MGAC having more people of color or women at the C-suite level that can literally reach down, and pull up, and prepare others for those leadership positions. That sponsorship, that's what we really need at the leadership level is people to actually say, "You know what? I'm gonna sponsor this person and I believe that I could give them the tools that they need in order to get to the next level and be at the C-suite level someday." I think that we need a little bit more of that.

Bryan: Brandey, I can already tell that you provide that mentorship to people who work with you and that's something that the type of mentorship that you're even giving me in this conversation is something that not everyone has. So, even right now, I have to say, thank you to you.

Brandey: Oh, thanks. I appreciate it.

Bryan: The next question, you touched upon this, tokenization.

Brandey: Yeah.

Bryan: Can you speak to increasing diversity and representation while avoiding tokenization?

Brandey: So, I think that most people have to understand what tokenization is and I think that's the problem that most people don't even recognize it when they're doing that. It's almost as though it's the Caucasian person saying, "I've got a black friend." Well, we know you got a black friend, but that doesn't mean anything.

Bryan: Absolutely. I know.

Brandey: I'm like, "Okay." You know, but the fact is that that's just an example of tokenization. One can't say, "Well, we've got this one guy over here that we put at a project executive level. We got a person of color that's sitting there," and it's like he's your token. And so I think that it's more a thing of being able to tell management and having management and even ownership recognize when they're doing it, and let them know, and inform them, and educate them that, you know, so, yeah, the black guy that you have sitting there as project executive, you only have one and he doesn't seem to be helping anybody else of color or anybody else of diverse nature even climb the corporate ladder. We've gotta do more. And so, I think that more so than anything the way to avoid it is to really have that conversation, an open and honest conversation with management and also too with ownership. The problem is who's gonna be brave enough to have those conversations?

Bryan: I was going to ask you that. When I was talking about tokenization, I believe it's about the intention behind elevating people into the C-suite or leadership positions. It shouldn't be just for the sake of diversity because at that point, you're defeating the purpose.

Brandey: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I think that some people, it's almost like they wanna check the box and we've got to get out of that mindset of checking the box. I know that sometimes when you move into the municipal market, the one thing that we do see is an overwhelming amount of required for disadvantaged small and local business, minority business, women-owned business, LGBTQ business, all of it. There's oftentimes requirements in those lines of business. And sometimes you might have somebody in management that says, "Why do we have to go out and give away 50% of our contract to this over here?" And it becomes a teachable moment. It becomes that we have to educate one. We can't just check the box. And instead of us going out and getting those partnerships or going to get one partnership, we have to really build the relationship with those partners. Let's not deal with one. Let's go out and let's have true relationships, joint ventures with these smaller businesses because it's not going away. It's not going anywhere. We're gonna have to be required to have it. So, that's just my thoughts on tokenization.

Bryan: For your coworkers who may not have had the personal experience with discrimination and negative treatment as a result of their identity, what advice would you give to them about how to be an ally?

Brandey: I would say make sure that you can have, again, that teachable moment with the person who made you feel that way. That's number one. Don't allow them to skate by. Please don't allow them to skate by because if they did it to you, they're gonna do it to somebody else.

Bryan: Right. Absolutely.

Brandey: And then it becomes a part of the corporate culture because somebody is allowing that person to continue to act in the way that they're acting. There's a way to say things to people professionally.

Bryan: Absolutely.

Brandey: The person's going to be offended anyway because they offended you, but the fact is that there's a way to say things professionally and address it professionally without it becoming an HR situation. Own who you are. This is the time and the place to really do that right now. You know, you can't have people more proud to be black, more proud to be Latino. You know, when Jennifer Lopez at the Super owl, when was that? Last year, the Super Bowl?

Bryan: Yes, yes.

Brandey: And I posted on Facebook, "I wish I was Latino right now." The fact is this is the time to actually be so proud. And so don't ever let somebody, again, take that away from you, and have that conversation with that person and let them know that they offended you, why you took offense to it and why it's wrong that they said what they said.

Bryan: I agree and it's all about having that conversation, approaching them, approaching it head-on, and being and remaining professional about it.

Brandey: Yes.

Bryan: Brandey, your voice is so powerful. I have loved speaking to you this past hour and you're right, people should own their diversity. I struggled for years with my heritage being Latino. I actually grew up right outside Washington, D.C. in Bethesda, Maryland, Rockville, Maryland area, which is predominantly white. So, I didn't accept myself. But now I'm thinking be unapologetically yourself, and be confident in yourself, and that's who you are, Brandey, and I love that. I have loved that. Every second of this conversation, I'm thinking, "Yes, Brandey. You're giving it to me, everything I need and I have loved speaking with you.

Brandey: Thank you, Bryan.

Bryan: With that, thank you for listening to this episode of "MGAC Inner Voices." Check back next month for our next episode.

Bryan: Hi, and welcome to another episode of "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. We want to preface this podcast by letting our listeners know that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We want to share our stories and discuss how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. Without further ado, I'm Bryan Gamez, your podcast host. I am a project manager at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today, we have the honor of speaking with my dear friend, Yanet Martinez.

Yanet: Hi, Bryan. I'm excited to be here today. I'm Yanet Martinez and I am an assistant project manager with MGAC at the Los Angeles office. I've been with MGAC for a little over a year and a half. My educational background is in landscape architecture. I am a licensed landscape architect, and I worked in that field for a couple years before I went on to work at a museum where I did both landscape and project management for capital projects before joining MGAC. I have been in the industry for over 12 years now.

Bryan: Well, I'm so happy to have you with us today, Yanet, I hope that we can have a great conversation. And I would like our listeners to know, what group do you identify with?

Yanet: I am a Latina woman in construction.

Bryan: And how would you say your identity has affected you in the professional space? Have there have been challenges that you have faced because you're a Latina woman?

Yanet: Yes, I think definitely being a woman has had its challenges. And being a Latina woman has probably added to those challenges in some sense or another in this industry that's primarily dominated by men.

Bryan: Are there any specific examples of any challenges that you have faced?

Yanet: Well, I think it's kind of interesting. You know, some of the challenges that come to mind have to do with people taking direction from me when I was in a supervisory role. You know, it's a little difficult sometimes to pinpoint exactly what it is. Is it because I'm a woman? Is it because I am a Latina woman? And in some instances, the question of age comes to mind. And I'm sure you might have the age as part of an experience. But you know, there have been instances on-site in having to provide crews with direction, which are primarily composed of men, that they have difficulty accepting direction from someone of my description to the point where I've had men yelling at me, or downplaying my professional experience, even as a client.

Bryan: Absolutely. What you have said has even happened to me. As a gay, Latino, and my age, I'm approaching 30. So being on the client-side, I have felt that I've had to face these challenges with men taking direction from us. And I think we have to be confident in ourselves and in our backgrounds to say, "You know what, this is who I am as a person, and this is what we're going to do." There are times where I've had to adapt to the workplace. Have you ever had to adapt who you are as a person in the workplace? And what motivated that and how did it affect you personally?

Yanet: I'd say yes, I've definitely had to adapt who I am culturally. But I think that it almost even begins beyond the workplace. And I understand that you know, the focus of this podcast is the workplace. But I think it's also important to talk about how people may have to adapt in other environments. For me, one of those instances was where I first experienced cultural adaptation first hit when I was in college. And for me, you know, growing up as a Latina first-generation, I guess I grew up in a community here in Carson in LA County, where I went to school with a very diverse demographic. But that was primarily consistent of, you know, Latino, black, and Filipino, and Samoan. And for me, I think my first kind of adaptation really was when I went to college and had to adapt to a culture that was more white. And, you know, I don't say that as a bad thing. But I think it presented to me challenges that perhaps other individuals going through the college experience didn't necessarily have to go through. And I know I'm kind of taking it a step back here. But I think it's important to talk about these things because oftentimes, even before you enter the workplace, individuals especially in certain minority groups, are faced with these challenges. And it's not that just that you're learning a career or profession, but you're learning how to socialize and interact with a culture that you're gonna have to adapt to once you enter the workplace, right?

Bryan: You're absolutely right, Yanet. You know, this may be a conversation about the workplace, but the conversation doesn't exist in a bubble just surrounding MGAC and our clients. You're right that you know, you're talking about your experiences from secondary school to college, and now beyond how that has left a lasting impact on yourself. And it resonates with me, and I'm sure it resonates with a lot of our listeners who come from diverse background. And for myself, as a Latino and going to college first-generation, I had to adjust to this other culture I wasn't aware of. So, I understand exactly where you're coming from, Yanet.

Yanet: And I'm shaking my head “yes” because I think it's important to talk about, if it helps anybody who's just kind of starting off to share that experience and that relation of like, I get it, you know. But I think it's important because I think that adaptation does start early on and it starts before you arrive to the workplace and even when you enter your profession, you continue to adapt. I think, you know, you can grow from these adaptations, that it's also kind of good to question and ask yourself, "How can I also introduce some of my culture into the workplace?"

Bryan: Do you ever feel comfortable though, adapting your persona in the workplace, to accommodate someone else's discomfort? Has that ever been an experience that you've gone through?

Yanet: I think yes and no. Maybe my discomfort has probably been in not speaking up or saying something, you know, because of potential reaction that I might receive.

Bryan: What is the greater big picture impact of having to go through this beyond just the specific events themselves? How do you think this is going to...how does this really affect or provide a greater perspective on this situation?

Yanet: Well, I think a big part of it is acknowledging it and having discussions and conversations about it, right? Which is what we're doing right now. And I think, you know, with a lot of what we saw, for example, in 2020 with Black Lives Matter and you know, people coming forward and speaking out, I feel frankly that I have it easy because even within the Latino community, I think that you sometimes see a color of the skin of how people treat you. And I am you know, a lighter skin Latina woman and I can see how that's also provided me advantages that, you know, it might not of my friend. And so, I see that, you know, not just for myself but for others. But I think it's exposing a reality whether we want it or not about a culture and creating these discussions. I think what we do with it now is what's gonna matter. And I think, you know, not just talking about it and saying, "Yes, I have the intention of doing something," but actually taking action and taking the steps to create a better culture.

Bryan: Right. And I think this is going to empower others to speak up, it's gonna provide greater visibility in the AEC industry as a whole. Of the lasting impacts that this treatment has had, I agree with you. I'm also a lighter-skinned Latino, and I had a brother and he was darker skinned, and people would treat us differently. And I just think that it's unfair that my skin color could have provided me an advantage that wasn't provided to my brother. And so, I understand greatly what you're saying. And the first step is having the conversation, right, Yanet?

Yanet: Exactly.

Bryan: Why do you think diversity, equity, and inclusion is important in the workplace, and what value does it add?

Yanet: I think it's super important. I think it brings different views and perspectives that you may not have otherwise had if you just limit it to one group. And I think by that not only are you creating a better workplace, a better company, but a better community.

Bryan: Absolutely, Yanet. How do you think your unique identity makes you a strong asset for the team? Here at MGAC, I know that when the office was open, we sat right next to each other. So, I know why you're a strong asset, but I hope that you can tell our listeners why you think you are?

Yanet: I know. I miss sitting next to you, Bryan. I can't wait to be back in the office.

Brayn: Yes.

Yanet: I really can't. I think everybody's experiences are different. And I think for me, my experience, my upbringing are a huge part of who I am and the principles that I carry into my work. I grew up working at my family's business from a very young age. And, you know, I carry those values with me in every project that I work on. That's an experience that, you know, I think it's very important to me, and I also feel like is a huge part for a lot of minority groups. You see a lot of minority groups having small businesses and being entrepreneurs. For some, their experience may be weighed heavier on education, but others might be work experiences. And not dismissing anybody's experience or background, no matter how different from your own, because what they bring to the table may surprise you.

Bryan: You speak about growing up with strong values and a business. Can you speak more about that?

Yanet: I think this has been you know, both maybe a blessing and a curse in a way. I worked with my family at a nursery. It was school and work. That was kind of the routine. And I think, again, I think a lot of my values that I bring to projects or to clients is that you treat that as your own and your success is the company's success. And I think that that is a blessing. And I think that's something that I would have...I don't know where else I could have learned that. I think it's something that you do from being part of a group and understanding that you're part of a team.

I think one of the things too, and it has to do I think maybe with the Latino culture, I'm sure it applies to many others, but you know, growing up, you work hard, you know, and I think that has benefited me tremendously. You work hard and to some degree, you don't complain. But in certain instances, you have to for your own self realize like how can I take these lessons and evolve them? And I think that for me, it's like yes, you do work hard. You know, you're going to come into situations and challenges where you do need to speak up and you do need to say, "Hey, this isn't right," and understand that maybe things that in your culture may be frowned upon may actually be required in a different setting, you know.

Bryan: And I think it's important to always remain confident in who you are and your background because it informs who you are as an individual and you shouldn't allow others to make that decision for you.

Yanet: Absolutely.

Bryan: So, I want to move into our industry as a whole. As project managers in the AEC industry, part of our job is to help advise clients when developing project teams, you know, creating a more equitable space. What are some ways that we can impact change through our work?

Yanet: Good leadership is always important as well as just mindfulness and communication. And I mean this with not just the project team but understanding the stakeholders and the end-users in the community and how is the project impacting those aspects of a bigger picture.

Bryan: What measures can our colleagues take when clients seem uncomfortable with diversity, Yanet? What's your opinion?

Yanet: I think, you know, like many things, it's just listening and communicating.

Bryan: Agreed. I think listening and communicating is one of the most effective tools in our tool chest. When it comes to clients who are uncomfortable with diversity, do you think that we should engage with them and tell them, you know, this is a moment in time where diversity is really crucial in our industry, and we should incorporate more of it due to the perspectives that other people can provide?

Yanet: Yeah, I think it's a tough question because you know, I think everyone has their process and how they're going to accept diversity. But I think that we can maybe help. And this goes for everybody, you know, it could be your neighbor or friend, not even specifically a client but just by providing positives for why diversity is so important and allowing them the time to process it. But I think we also need to understand that everybody is going to process things differently and at different times. So, from our perspective allowing people to go through that process, and it's not always going to be overnight.

Bryan: Right. What advice would you give to young people pursuing AEC careers that think they might face discrimination in the workplace?

Yanet: I think that despite my challenges, I've been super blessed and surprised at how many people rooted for me. I think that at the end of it the good always outweighs the bad. And staying positive that yes, challenges are always going to be presented in some form or another, but I think you see them as opportunities for growth.

Bryan: You rise above them.

Yanet: Yeah. It might be growth for yourself, or it might be an opportunity for you and that person that might be presenting the challenge to also grow.

Bryan: A learning opportunity for everyone. That's a great point. How would you like to normalize the conversation of diversity in the workplace? Do you think we need to normalize it?

Yanet: I think you just do it. I think you just start talking about it, you know?

Bryan: You begin the conversation by doing exactly what we're doing, we have created this forum for us to publicly speak about it and I hope to see that within other companies as well. And also give other people the opportunity to be more courageous to speak up because when you have more courage you are able to have more meaningful conversations about diversity and what that means to others. It also allows...I touched upon this previously about vulnerability, being vulnerable, allowing people to come in and listen to your stories, I think that is going to normalize diversity in the workplace. Do you think that's the best approach? What do you think your approach would be?

Yanet: I 100% agree with you. I think oftentimes and you know, speaking from my experience you know, I am of the thinking where it's like, "Oh, I don't want to bother someone with my experience or my story or something like that." I think I was kind of nervous just even doing this. I'm like, I don't know that my story is relevant, you know, but...

Bryan: Your story is 100% relevant, Yanet. I want you to know that.

Yanet: And that's the thing though. I think that people are going to surprise you. And I think that goes back to, you know, what I said, there are more people rooting for you than not. And people want to hear those stories. I'll tell you this, I remember at my last job having project meetings, and I was on the client end at that point. And I'd be sitting in a meeting with 30 people, architects, engineers, contractors, you name it. And out of that room, there were probably four women, you know, and it kind of went to show you again, that imbalance in the diversity. But the thing is that a lot of the people in that room were supportive. They wanted to see more diversity and wanted to hear your stories. I think you'd be surprised when you share your story that people are interested in learning more.

Bryan: That's why your story is so relevant. You talk about you being one of four women in that room. You have that voice, Yanet, and it's a powerful tool, and I hope you continue to use it. What do you think our industry is going to look like in 10 years' time in 2031? Crazy to think about that.

Yanet: I hope that, again, these conversations that have been triggered by the Black Lives Matter movement, I hope that they continue to carry out and not just in words, but in actions, right? And by that I think that if we do continue as a society to step in that direction, I think we're going to just be more innovative overall in the way that we approach things. Yeah.

Bryan: Absolutely. I think having people in leadership positions who genuinely care about LGBTQ, Latinos, Latinas, black men, black women, that will create an environment that's conducive to new innovations, new ideas, and the future of the AEC industry is boundless when we harness everyone's ideas.

Yanet: Absolutely. Yeah.

Bryan: How can we bake the DEI into MGAC's DNA?

Yanet: Obviously, this podcast is a great example. Other things that MGAC has started, a book club for the staff, that's great and these calendars. It's fun, because you get to see, for example, the January one, I saw El Día de Reyes, right. And I can remember going to Mexico when I was young every winter and celebrating it and now to be like, "Yeah, oh, my God. I can see it here." But then also seeing other holidays from other cultures where I'm like, "Oh, wow. I want to go and be part of that celebration next year." Those are some great efforts that have already taken place. I think it's important that these things such as a podcast, such as the book club, it shows an initiative of actually taking those intents and making them into action.

Bryan: Right.

Yanet: You saw a lot of posts on social media, companies with intent, and I think, you know, actually seeing these companies carry out is important.

Bryan: Yeah. And to our listeners who are wondering what Yanet was referencing, our marketing team, and our HR department has created a diversity, equity, and inclusion calendar, which has dates of holidays significant to other cultures. And Yanet was talking about Three Kings Day in Mexico. And these are initiatives that MGAC is now baking into our company, to begin the conversation about other groups of people, and also providing awareness and visibility to others that we may have never even thought about before. So, I agree with you, Yanet, this is an incredible step forward. And I hope that other companies do engage in action like that because companies say they're going to do it, they're going to splash a signature with a rainbow font and say they support LGBTQ individuals or women and whatnot, but no hard action is ever taken. So, I agree with you that that's the best way we can continue to evolve the conversation.

Yanet: Yes, absolutely.

Bryan: So, if you were going to establish a company from the ground up, Yanet, how would you ensure that diversity, equity, inclusion were central to the company's ideals?

Yanet: Well, I guess it always starts from the top, right? By demonstrating it through the leadership and creating an environment of open communication. I think transparency is an important part of the company in creating a trust between the leadership and the staff.

Bryan: I know a big conversation regarding diversity is regarding tokenization. How do you increase diversity while avoiding tokenization? And I know, Yanet, that I struggled with this question when it was posed to me but I want to get your thoughts on it.

Yanet: I think it's an interesting question and I think you know this goes back to my earlier responses where I think it starts early on. One of the ways that you can do that is by early outreach and mentorship. I know for me in my experiences, one of the things that was very important to me were those internships that I had when I was in high school. You know, if I'm honest with you when I was in high school, I wasn't even thinking about going to college and some of these opportunities were very important and help define my path. I guess what I'm trying to say is that by providing early outreach and early mentorship you show that you're invested in the future versus just getting someone once they've made that achievement of completing their education and gaining a few years of experience in the field and that you're not just taking one or two people here to meet a quota, but that you're actually invested in these communities that could use these opportunities and that have potential and perhaps only need some sort of boost or mentorship to guide them in that.

And I think that when you do that you're investing in a person, but you're investing in creating a great company. I think when companies talk about increasing their diversity and they show it by doing outreach and mentorship early on it shows their commitment to the future and actually taking you know, DEI seriously. I think some great examples are you know, ACE Mentor Program and Project Destined. They start seeing that, and I think it transforms and impacts everybody that's involved.

Bryan: Absolutely. So, for any of your co-workers who may have never experienced discrimination and negative treatment because of their identity, what advice would you give for them to be an ally?

Yanet: Something that I even tell myself is just be mindful of unconscious bias because we're all guilty of it I guess to some degree and just being mindful and respectful. But I think in an instance where they might find someone that is being discriminated against or treated negatively and if that person or individual can't speak up for themselves, just be an ally, be a friend.

Bryan: It comes down to respect, right?

Yanet: Yeah.

Bryan: And also comes back to teachable moments, communicating and educating someone to ensure that everyone is respected in the workplace.

Yanet: Absolutely, yeah, exactly. I think just being respectful and if someone is treating someone that way stepping in and lending a hand.

Bryan: And with that, Yanet, you have lent a hand to other Latina women in the AEC industry today with our conversation. It's been such a pleasure to speak with you today, and I'm hoping that you had a good time with me, and I thank you so much.

Yanet: Thank you, Bryan. I had so much fun.

Bryan: And thank you to our listeners for listening to this episode of MGAC Inner Voices. Check back next month for our next episode.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our corporate headquarters projects.</em>

Whether we are working with clients who are building from the ground up or renovating; who own their own real estate or are leasing, we approach each challenge with the same driving purpose: finding and implementing the best solution to achieve the best outcome for our client.
<h4><strong>Beginnings</strong></h4>
Customization of real estate and building solutions to meet the needs of a single organization date back to our origin in 1996, when MGAC began working with law firms to build inspired headquarters. Legal spaces at the time were large, and their building requirements highly specific. Secure spaces, heavy floor loading for what were massive case rooms, increased cooling capacity for high-occupancy conference areas, interconnection of floors, and massive plans for growth lead to a robust business in law firm build-to-suit projects.

To say we had tapped into that potential would be an understatement: over the next 15 years, MGAC would oversee more than 4,300,000 SF of law firm space that spanned the United States—from Washington, DC to New York, West Palm Beach, Houston, Denver, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. By 2000, our law firm project business took us across the Atlantic for our first overseas projects in London and Brussels. This work broadened our understanding of the possible: bespoke projects tailored to meet a particular organization’s highly specific facility requirements.
<h4><strong>Taking Things Up A Notch</strong></h4>
In 2009, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/hilton-worldwide-headquarters/191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilton Worldwide</a> announced it would move its headquarters from Southern California to Northern Virginia. Longstanding, great relationships led to MGAC being engaged in the transcontinental move, which immediately became <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/hilton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a race against the clock</a>. Our task: to relocate the headquarters and provide site selection and real estate acquisition, project management, program management, design and construction management, furniture procurement, and move management—all in a matter of six months.

Our success paved the way for a decades long partnership with Hilton Worldwide with multiple projects at the headquarters expanding, renovating, and customizing the space to meet their growing corporate requirements.
<h4><strong>Six Years, Many Projects</strong></h4>
The next six years brought a rush of exciting corporate work—each with unique challenges to overcome, opportunities to realize, and missions to be accomplished.

<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-greetings-headquarters/190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Greetings</a> retained us in 2014 when their prior project management firm struggled to meet the company’s needs. Having spent sixty years in their Brooklyn, OH, campus, its owners decided to find a new home for the 1,800 employees they consider family. They enlisted MGAC on their new headquarters designed to modernize their workspace, harnessing the incredible creativity of the American Greetings staff. The new 600,000 SF, ground-up build-to-suit headquarters is a source of pride for all involved.

In 2016, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/urban-institute-headquarters/77" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Institute</a> looked to MGAC to relocate its 100,000 SF headquarters for the first time in a generation. Urban Institute’s stakeholders were used to their old location, therefore the new headquarters had to be a complete shift in the organization. Modifying the building to accommodate a customized multi-story reception space, a five-story internal staircase, and customized roof deck became the mission which the team was able to accomplish.

<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile</a> chose to partner with MGAC shortly thereafter on its 1,400,000 SF campus renovation in Bellevue, WA. As T-Mobile’s business expanded, the requirements grew, and the campus consequently has expanded east along I-90. The incredible new T-Mobile headquarters is a complete expression of the T-Mobile brand, emphasizing their smarts, their collaborative nature, and relentless focus on caring for their customers and their team members.

Corporate change brings new demands. DXC Technology is a company born from a corporate divestiture. As their business stood on its own, and blossomed, DXC partnered with our firm to deliver 400,000 SF of headquarters and workplace. The timing of the divestiture was extremely brief, therefore our mission to deliver their project was critical to DXC. MGAC came through and continues to work with DXC on various projects throughout the country.

In 2019, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-geophysical-union-agu-headquarters/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Geophysical Union</a> (AGU) engaged MGAC to lead one of the most innovative projects in Washington, DC history: the first net-zero energy renovation of a commercial office building in the City. While reaching this status in an existing building in the heart of DC was no easy feat, it was important for the AGU team to live up to their mission of ensuring a sustainable future. This same year, we also commenced work on multiple projects for Freddie Mac, including their new McLean, VA headquarters and branch offices in Dallas and Los Angeles.

Recently, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-selected-by-sherwin-williams-to-deliver-new-hq-and-rd-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sherwin-Williams Company</a> became the latest major brand to enlist MGAC’s services. We were selected to deliver its new global headquarters in downtown Cleveland and its new Research and Development Center in the nearby suburb of Brecksville. These new facilities will house more than 3,500 employees with room for future growth and will bring a minimum of 400 jobs to the area over time.
<h4><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h4>
As our work with Hilton Worldwide, T-Mobile, DXC Technology, Freddie Mac, and Sherwin-Williams continues, we are thrilled to also be pushing the envelope on new headquarters for several major technology and media firms across the country. With inventive visions that spare no epic detail (custom art and furniture, environmental graphics, and innovative technologies), our team helps these companies strike a balance between form and function to deliver projects that create a great first impression and also serve as an inspired workplace.]]></content:encoded>

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi, I'm Isabella Villigas, VP of Project Management at MGAC. Today we're at our new Toronto office. Let's get moving!</em>

<em>We decided to move our office to the Sterling Junction because of the vibrant community-centric culture that surrounds the area. The building itself was an industrial building where it transitioned to moving factory in the past. Our neighbors are artists, photographers, architects, digital studios, and coffee roasters, to name a few. We have a beautiful view of the CN Tower and the Museum of Contemporary Art. We're excited about the many transit access options in the area, with the subway, GO train, and UP Express to the north, as well as the College and Dundas streetcars to the south. The West Railpath, for those of us who enjoy biking to work, is also an added luxury. We have an abundance of local restaurants to be spoiled by during the lunch and happy hours. We're happy to be settling in at our new office location. </em>

<em>I hope you enjoyed seeing our new Toronto office. Follow us to see MGAC's next move!</em>]]></content:encoded>

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Hi Alicia! It’s great to have you on the Impact Blog. Tell us what you do at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Alicia Fleming (AF):</strong> I’m a Senior Project Manager located in MGAC’s Toronto office. Currently, I’m working on a number of projects, largely in the commercial sector.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Tell us about that—what’s keeping you busy these days? </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I’ve been involved with our client T-Mobile for going on two years now. I can’t believe it’s already been that long! Initially, I was brought onto MGAC’s project management team to help support the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bellevue headquarters renovation</a>. That work has led to continued support and collaboration with T-Mobile, and I am part of MGAC’s project management team that continues to partner with them on the additional real estate portfolio needs they have.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Nice. And how are things in the Toronto office?</strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>Our Toronto office is really in a stage of growth. It’s been exciting to work with our office leadership to optimize our market strategy and help solidify our action plans for the year.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That includes an office move, right?</strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>That is correct! Our current office is about 45 minutes outside of downtown Toronto. We’re moving into a vibrant up-and-coming neighborhood in the city. It’s going to really transform in the next couple of years. We're going to have some great neighbors and are just excited to be a part of it all. And after the year we’ve all had with the pandemic, it just feels like a great fresh start.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Yes, absolutely! How long have you been on board? </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I’ve been at MGAC for just over three years now.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What were you doing before you came to MGAC?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I was in the Toronto area working at a large engineering consulting firm when I was first introduced to MGAC. At the time, I remember being really drawn to MGAC’s philosophy of more of a client-focused approach to its projects, as well as its commitments to its clients’ missions. I started my career out at a smaller firm, where I felt very connected to the projects I was working on. And, while I did learn a lot about business working at a large engineering firm, I wanted to get back to the fundamental work we get to do as project managers for our clients. I love talking to clients about projects, what makes them tick, and what’s important to them. For all those reasons, I knew MGAC would be a good fit for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>It sounds like you were spot on. Were you always on track to work in project management? </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Not exactly. When I was younger, and it came time to start thinking about what I was going to do career-wise, I was so sure I wanted to be an architect. I had no back-up plan; I didn't apply to any other programs of study! It’s funny looking back, because architecture programs, at least here in Canada, are notoriously competitive and difficult to get into. So, not having a back-up plan was probably not the smartest thing—but it all ended up working out in the long run!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Interesting! So how did that ultimately lead you to the path you’re on today? </strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>Studying architecture was my first introduction to this industry. I was lucky that the program was very multidisciplinary. It gave me exposure to everything from building envelope design to construction project management. And that gave me a window into all the different facets of a project, which was so much more than architectural design. I found myself wanting to be a part of that bigger picture. So that’s how I ended up in project management.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s a great introduction to the project management world. When you think about your work with MGAC today, what impact do you hope to have?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> We are so lucky that we get to work on things that materialize into something physical. Ultimately, I hope the work I do solves problems for people. It might be creating a space that contributes to an occupant’s health, mood, and productivity. Or maybe it’s job creation. Maybe it’s creating a new experience. What we do in this industry has a profound impact on people. That’s a really rewarding aspect of the job.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>It seems like you’re always thinking about how your work will impact your community at large. </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Absolutely. The projects we work on will ultimately become a part of a city’s fabric. And I hope the structures we create represent the cities in which they stand. I hope they reflect the values, the culture, and the success of the people who live and work there.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What have you learned at MGAC?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Two things come to mind. First, integrity is everything. It’s so important to do what you say you’re going to do, and to be trustworthy, honest, and reliable. That is in MGAC’s core fundamentals. We must hold ourselves to a higher standard to set the best example for the people around us.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s such an important value to live up to. What’s the second? </strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>The other thing MGAC has taught me is that a company’s most valuable asset is its people. They determine the client’s experience. If it’s a good experience, we win. It’s really that simple.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> All the wonderful people who make MGAC what it is. We have such a diverse group of people who work with us. They come from diverse professional backgrounds, and they all bring their own perspective to what we do every day. It’s really refreshing.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And that must influence the work you’re able to do for clients. </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Having the opportunity to evaluate something from a range of perspectives really enhances the work we do. Plus, everyone is so open and transparent with each other, and always willing to lend a helping hand. Sometimes you may be the only one from MGAC on a particular project. Knowing you have that support back in the office really makes all the difference.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> For me, there's a lot of things that go into feeling job satisfaction. It can be something as little as making a client happy with small wins. It can also be seeing all the hard work you put in as a project manager, together with your collective team, materialize into something. It’s just amazing to see what we can accomplish when we work as a team for the common goal. It’s powerful—and really gratifying.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Making all that happen takes so much coordination and effort. What gives you energy to tackle it all?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> In my personal life, it’s friends, family, and places. Professionally, I’d say my team and my colleagues, and also new challenges. Problem-solving requires a level of creativity, intuition, and skills. But, it also requires patience. Those are things that really invigorate me and give me a sense of purpose in what I do.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> These days, a nice walk around the neighborhood really helps me decompress. Fresh air and movement really work for me. Maybe listening to a good podcast, too. That all helps me shake off the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What are your podcast go-to’s?  </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I mix it up! Sometimes, they’re about personal and business development—I’m a fan of “The Modern Mentor” and “Coaching Real Leaders.” Other times, I’ll put on podcasts that cover popular culture, social media, and news events in a fun way.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What’s a book that has made a significant impact on your life?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I think one of the books that comes to mind is <em>The Year of Yes.</em> It’s a bit of a memoir, and it’s about a year-long experiment where the author endeavors to say “yes” to everything in her life, personally and professionally, no matter what.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What a cool concept! </strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>It really is. The purpose is to highlight that in life, it’s really easy to just say “no” to something. To say “no” to a new opportunity, “no” to a challenge, “no” to meeting new people. Ultimately, it’s about overcoming fear and self-doubt—and also about being kind to yourself and recognizing your own power. Because we often are our own harshest critics.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> One that has really resonated with me recently is “You must do the thing you think you cannot do.” It’s really about strength, courage, and confidence, and ultimately personal growth.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>We’ve talked about winding down at the end of a long day...what about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> My morning routine has certainly evolved over the last year. Prior to this pandemic, we all had a different routine that involved getting ourselves out the door and starting our commute. But these days, I’m typically using my morning to do some self-care. I’ve been reading about the benefits of meditation: taking a few minutes to focus inward and really start your day off with some mindfulness. I focus on my water intake. I’ll read the news and slowly sip on my beloved coffee. I also try to get in a high-intensity workout several times a week.  I think all these little rituals help me. They give me a sense of calmness and are fuel for my day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>It sounds like you’re establishing routines that will be useful even once COVID is in the rear-view. </strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>I think that’s what this year has been all about. It has given people space and time to look inward and think about what is and isn’t working for them. I have read so much about stress levels going way down as people look at things in a different way. That’s not to say this past year hasn’t taken a toll on people’s mental health, but I think overall stress levels from our daily grind have gone down a bit—and that’s a positive thing. There are habits we’ve been able to form over the last year that we should certainly take with us.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I am a very strong believer in mentorship. I was lucky early on in my career to have two really good female mentors, and that did wonders for me professionally. That’s one of my goals going forward. Even if I don’t have a dedicated mentee, if I’m working with someone who is more junior than me or I see there is an opportunity to offer them something, I try to bring that to the table. I believe there is such a power in mentorship and bringing someone along with you as you evolve in your career, so I try to practice and have that mentality on all the projects I work on.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How incredible. The idea of female-driven mentorship feels especially meaningful in this industry. </strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>It’s so true. MGAC does a fabulous job of not just hiring women, but promoting women. And that’s really great. But, the reality is when we go out in the industry—on our job sites, in client’s offices— that diverse landscape is not always the same. There have been many times in my career where I have been the only female at a boardroom table during a meeting. It’s not uncommon. For me, having that mentorship early in my career gave me the confidence I needed to lead people. And that’s the job! So, I can’t say enough about mentorship and the lasting impact it can have on people.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Now, we have a few rapid-fire questions for you to answer. Are you ready? </strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Absolutely!<strong> </strong>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Making a difference.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> If I’m at the office, it would definitely be to say hello to my colleagues and catch-up, make coffee. Now that I’m at home, it’s definitely still making coffee! And getting mentally prepared for the day ahead.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the last thing?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I do a brain-dump of everything going on. I jot down notes of things I’m thinking about and make my to-do list for the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Making your to-do list at the end of the day prior is a new one! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Earplugs, maybe?

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Interesting! For job sites?</strong>

<strong>AF: </strong>They’re multi-purpose! I do wear them on job sites. I also used to travel a lot, and they’re great on an airplane and in airports. And they’re also handy if I’m in the city or on the subway and need a little bit of quiet.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Very multi-purpose! What can't you leave home without?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I’m going to really shock you with this one: my cell phone.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I’m a leftovers kind of gal. It just makes my life easy. (That’s applicable to at-home <em>and</em> in the office.)

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Probably Messenger or WhatsApp. A lot of my friends are in the U.S. now, but over the years, I’ve had friends in Kenya—all over the place! WhatsApp helps keep us connected.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> Maybe that I’m a pretty athletic person. Growing up as a kid, there wasn’t a sport that I didn't play. I was on all the teams during my school years. I even did alpine skiing and raced professionally.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> I can honestly say that I hope that I am still doing rewarding work; I’m still part of projects that are making a difference for people and their businesses. I hope that I am still working at this great organization, MGAC. It really has had a profound impact on me. And I hope to continue to progress within the company. Whether it’s Vice President or some other role, continuing to grow and evolve professionally is really a priority for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your biggest work goal for 2021?</strong>

<strong>AF:</strong> To take a lot of the things we’ve learned over the course of this year and apply them practically. I’m not sure yet exactly what that’s going to look like, but taking everything we know and have learned—about ourselves, the world around us, and our clients—and translating it into practice. Here at MGAC, I think we can be a conduit for people. We all know that we’re not going to go back to what things were. Helping our clients come to the realization of what this transition period looks like, and what changes lie ahead, is key. This year is going to be what you make of it.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hello, my name is Uzair Faruqui, I'm a senior project manager at MGAC. Let's get moving. Today we're at Astéras Kings, a 25-unit luxury apartment building in West Hollywood, California developed by Astéras's properties based out of Los Angeles, California.</em>

<em>One of my favorite features about this project is the seamless integration from the indoor spaces to the outdoor spaces. In the kitchen area, you have an indoor-outdoor bar with bi-fold stacking, sliding windows. In the living room patio area, you have stacking sliding doors that are full height. And many of the units have indoor-outdoor atriums or light waves that give natural light all the way to the center of every single unit.</em>

<em>Hope you enjoyed seeing what's happening at Astéras Kings. Follow MGAC to see our next move.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our hotels and resorts projects. </em>
<h4><strong>Humble Beginnings</strong></h4>
In the early years, MGAC had the right mix of talent to be successful in the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/hospitality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hospitality</a> market. Our staff included (and still includes) multi-year veterans of the Marriott Architecture and Construction Department and former contractors with hotel experience. So, breaking into the hospitality market made sense, and in 2001, we were fortunate enough to be invited to an “industry day” by a major hotel owner.

We walked in, sat down with our coffees, and waited for the meeting to begin. The executive hosting the meeting welcomed everyone and invited us—as the first group in alphabetical order among hospitality project managers, architects, and hotel contractors—to present our qualifications. Given the lack of agenda prior to the meeting, and certainly unaware of an expected presentation component to the day, we had absolutely nothing prepared. Our best efforts at thinking on our feet fell flat, and barely a minute later, the hotel executive said, “Wow, you guys obviously have no hotel experience. How did you make it into this room?”

We have certainly come a long way from this meeting but enjoy reflecting on this story as it is emblematic of our firm’s enterprising spirit. Getting to where you want to be starts with putting yourself out there and taking on new challenges, and we have done that successfully in the hospitality space every year since. Since that “industry day,” MGAC has managed over $2.6B in hospitality projects throughout the United States, Canada, and the Middle East. We have delivered over 24,000 keys for brands including Ritz Carlton, W, JW Marriott, Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Westin, as well as other independent brands.
<h4><strong>Taking Things Up A Notch</strong></h4>
After that absolutely humbling meeting, we hit the ground running and, once again, did not back down from the challenges in front of us. Our earliest hospitality projects were in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, just when everyone prognosticated that no one would ever travel by air again, and hotels were a dying industry (sound familiar?). This early work included smaller renovations of meeting spaces, restaurants, lobbies, and eventually guestrooms. MGAC’s geographic reach lead the very same company that hosted that early “industry day” meeting to begin utilizing our services for two major renovations of over 1,300 rooms in the Pacific Northwest. Soon, we became one of only two or three firms undertaking these projects nationally for our client.
<h4><strong>Game Changers</strong></h4>
Those smaller projects progressively grew into larger work and, in 2006, our very first hospitality client referred us to the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/salamander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salamander Resort and Spa</a>. The aspiration was simple but demanding: to create a unique five-star sustainable country estate of uncompromising quality that fosters healthy lifestyles for its guests and the Middleburg community alike. Meeting that goal required navigating quite a few unique challenges, and two previous project management firms were unable to get the project off the ground. The residents of Middleburg, Virginia are environmentally conscious people who are proud and protective of the rural lands they call home. As such, the project faced community opposition and numerous zoning and entitlement challenges. Our team participated in over 25 public and private hearings and ultimately was successful in winning town annexation of the property from Loudoun County. Where others had failed, we overcame the hurdles and delivered, and the project has continued to be an enormous success.

The completion of Salamander led to major renovation projects throughout the Caribbean, including the renovation of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/jaragua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renaissance Jaragua Hotel and Casino</a> in the Dominican Republic. The complex $60M urban redevelopment project faced language and cultural barriers, and a lack of codified processes for development projects. MGAC team members became experts in Dominican regulations and entitlement procedures. Forming relationships and performing due diligence, the team was able to identify a local construction team that had the experience and resources needed to complete a project of this size. The renovated hotel now reflects luxurious new brand standards for Renaissance and will serve locals and guests for generations to come.

The relationships we formed on Salamander, Jaragua, and many other projects have carried through to today in our hospitality practice. The financial firms we worked with on those projects have grown and now work with MGAC’s hospitality team on projects throughout the country. Our client base has diversified and now consists of private investment firms, REITs, management companies, and developers.
<h4><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h4>
From the Bulgari Resort and Marina in Dubai to multiple projects in <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/the-westin-grand-cayman-seven-mile-beach-resort-and-spa/110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Cayman</a> and the Caribbean, to our more recent work such as the high-rise development of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/5th-and-stewart-hotel-residences/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5<sup>th</sup> and Stewart Luma Hotel and Residences</a> in Downtown Seattle, our hospitality team has had the opportunity to work on a wide range of exciting projects. We have grown quite a bit from those "How did you make it into this room?" days and, today, are honored to be the go-to team for some of the world's most interesting and complex hospitality projects. There are always new challenges on the horizon in hospitality, and we are still just as eager to meet those as we were on day one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At MGAC, we are always looking to expand our leadership team with the best talent in the industry, and we have found that in <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/jeremy-oliver/98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Oliver</a>, MGAC’s newest Senior Vice President. He comes to the team with over 17 years of experience in the construction industry, having managed project teams across the United States. Over the past few years, that work has included large-scale project work for Fortune 500 companies and other household names across a wide range of industries. In his next chapter at MGAC, Jeremy will be overseeing and growing the firm’s San Francisco office.

“We couldn’t be more thrilled to bring Jeremy on board,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mark Anderson</strong></a>, Founder and President of MGAC. “He brings a wealth of experience to the firm and as someone who was born and raised in the Bay Area, Jeremy knows the lay of the land. Our San Francisco team is talented, and our work there includes some of the most interesting projects we have been engaged with to date. I’m eager to watch as that work continues to grow under Jeremy’s leadership.”

“This is a relationship-based business at its core, and MGAC has a 25-year reputation that’s built on long-lasting relationships,” says Jeremy. “I’m extremely excited and humbled by the opportunity to build on and grow new relationships in the Bay Area.”

Jeremy currently calls the Bay Area home and, having spent most of his life in greater San Francisco, has no plans to leave. When not working, can be found chasing his two young children, and in the winter, planning snowboarding trips to Lake Tahoe.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, everyone, welcome to ''MGAC Inner Voices,'' a podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. As always, I wanna preface this podcast by letting you know that we're not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wanna share our stories and discuss how, together, we can create a better outcome for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. As you all may know, I'm Bryan Gamez, your host. I am assistant project manager at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles. And today, we have the special privilege of talking to a fellow LA office member, Jayson. What's up, Jayson, how are you?

Jayson: Hey, Bryan, I'm doing great. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Jayson Lacno-Musngi. I'm a cost consultant in the LA office. I've actually been with the firm for about almost five years in June. So it's funny because this is actually my first job right out of college. So in terms of professional experience, this is pretty much...I've been, from the very get-go, at MGAC.

Bryan: Wow, you're a veteran of the LA office. It's so interesting to our listeners, Jayson and I met just about two months before the pandemic, and we left the office, and we haven't seen each other since then. So I would like you to tell our audience more about your identity.

Jayson: Okay. Yeah. So I would say that, you know, just looking at me, I would look Asian, but I am Filipino. My parents were actually both born in the Philippines. I'm the first generation, you know, the first to come over here for my family.

Bryan: I'm also first-generation as well. So I can relate to yourself and where you're at. I've also been in the industry for about almost six years now. I'm interested to know more about how your identity has really affected you in the professional space, and also if you've ever really faced any challenges in your career because of your identity.

Jayson: Being an Asian or Filipino in the construction industry, it's quite interesting, in a sense, because, you know, I would say for the most part, the construction industry is, you know, white dominated, and being an Asian coming into this industry is little, you know, eye-changing or...you know, I don't really have any family members or any, like, friends to say that I could relate to that actually work in this industry. So for me to be coming into this is kind of, like, you know, as being blind, I'm the first one to experience all these interactions with, you know, other professionals. So I'd say, for the most part, like, I've had a great experience, you know, meeting a lot of these professionals. I haven't had any really big issues. If anything, it's a little bit more about little small mannerisms that I've noticed that are different from, you know, my upbringing or where I came from.

Bryan: Can you tell us a little bit about that or elaborate what you mean by mannerisms?

Jayson: So, let's see, I guess the mannerisms that I've grown up, you know, like, taking from my family, it's like a lot of them it's, you know, like very strong eye contact and, you know, like, strong and firm handshake. So this is something I've noticed, like...as a kid, I have noticed, like, I shouldn't be having these, like, strong gazing, you know, eye contact with my parents because, in a sense, I would think, just from my personal experience, it kind of feels like a disrespect to, like, you know, stare them straight into the eyes. And then we didn't really, you know, give, like, handshakes, you know. When we greeted one another, it's more of like a kiss on the cheek and stuff like that. So it's kind of different, like, you know, especially being a professional, it's like, you know, it's more, it's like a handshake.

I didn't really handshake, you know, my relatives or, like, friends or anything like that. You know, it's a little bit different from a professional standpoint, but I guess, like, you know, the mannerisms it's like, it's very subtle if anything. Yeah. I don't know. It's hard to explain. Cause, you know, like, when I try to think about these small mannerisms that, like, are different from, you know, how I grew up to say, like, you know, the construction industry or more professional career, you know, for me it's normal. Like, I've grown up doing the same thing over and over. Like, you know, when we greet, you know, my friends in, like, high school, also, you know, we say, like, "What's up?" you know, all this stuff, you know. You know, you started getting into, you know, the professional industry, it's kind of like, you're taught, like, "Okay, you need to be professional. This is how they speak. This is how we should speak."

You know, when you introduce yourself, you're like, "Oh, hi, I'm Jayson." You know, eye contact, firm handshake, everything like that. But, you know, it's kind of like a term, because I didn't ever saw my family do that. Whenever, you know, my family would tell me to...or, for example, like, you know, my parents, you know, are from the Philippines, and they kind of have a hard time speaking English, especially my dad. And so a lot of times, you know, when he asked me to say, for example, like, you know, call something for the bills or something like that, you know, it's like he's telling me to call them. And, you know, the interaction is very interesting because I have to pretend I'm him. And, you know, I'm just like this 12 year old talking on the phone, it's like, "Oh yeah, what's your social security? Are you Mr..."

You know, I have to talk as my dad. I'm like, yeah, my social is this, I'm like a little kid. And, like, he gets mad at me because I'm not asking the right questions so that I have to, like, kind of translate it back and forth. And it's like, it's interesting because, like, I'm just thinking, like, you know, like, this isn't normal for everyone, but, like, as for, like immigrants, I would say, this is, like, you know, an everyday thing that happens all the time.

Bryan: You're bringing up my childhood too, because my mom speaks English, but she has a strong, heavy accent. So she would do the same thing to me. She'd be like, "We're gonna talk to the bill people." But I noticed they treated me a lot differently than they would have treated my mom because of the accent. And that, to me, was just baffling. And I'm assuming your parents weren't in, like, a professional white-collar, white workforce, right? My mom wasn't, as well.

So it's interesting that you say we entered the workforce. We're learning to be professional in an industry that is dominated by white men. And when you're entering that workforce, you're picking up their mannerisms, you're picking up and you're learning. And, like, how you were saying, it was a learning curve for you, and it's been a learning curve for me. And now that we're, you know, here five years and six years into our careers, it's just interesting to look back and think, wow, you assimilated into this professional setting, but you still look back and think to your roots.

Jayson: This is very interesting because I'm thinking about, like, you know, my upbringing. I was born off in San Diego. I moved to Carson, like, when I was about two years old. And then, you know, I come to realize the reason why my parents moved to these cities is because it's a big Asian, or more specifically, Filipino-dominated city. I'm looking at a census right now. I just, like, Googled Carson real quick. In 2010, you know, 25% of it was Asian. But out of that 25%, you know, 20% or plus is Filipino, which is, you know...it's an interesting fact, because you know, my parents, especially for them to come as immigrants, you know, they want to be somewhere where they're comfortable, and, you know, being somewhere comfortable is seeing people that look like you.

Like, I mean, I can understand now, looking back at it, it's like why they moved to these cities, because, you know, it's scary, you know, moving to a new country. Everything's different, all the mannerisms. And the thing is, especially since they were adults coming into it, it's harder for them to pick up these mannerisms and adjust to it as, you know, for us when we're, you know...like, if we're born here, you know, like, we start to pick it up in grade school right away. So it's like, okay, we learned that this is the way how people talk to each other and what not.

Bryan: What you're saying resonates completely with me. So I wanna know, have you ever faced discrimination in the workplace or, like, have there ever been instances where you have felt people in positions of power within the organization have, like, discriminated against you? Have you seen discrimination to people who identify similar to you?

Jayson: So, for the most part, I think I'm lucky that, you know, we're in the LA office, and our office is very diverse. It's very, very mixed, for the most part, and especially our office, I feel, like, completely comfortable. But there has been some times where I noticed that going into meetings, it's predominantly white men, you know. And it's like, it's a different atmosphere. You know, as soon as you walk in, you get this, like, little hesitation of, you know, like, I don't look like them. I have to interact in a certain way to, you know, get my point across.

Bryan: I felt that. You're adapting to a persona where you hope that they recognize you, that they see you, and that they're listening to you, because when you are a minority, you always have in the back of your head, that, "My opinion may not matter as much as these folks."
Jayson: Exactly.

Bryan: And that's unfair to us, it's unfair to you. I mean, this is one of the things I love about this podcast is exploring these themes of communication...nonverbal communication, really, because you're talking about how you're entering a room, and all of a sudden, you think, "Wow, these people..." We're so affected by how people see or view us because of how we identify through these minority groups. And it's to a point where it's like, how do we, you know, assert ourselves in our opinions and make ourselves known that we are here to, you know, be just as successful as they are.
Jayson: Yeah. It's exactly what I was trying to get at. You know, it's interesting because in your head, like, you know, I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm gonna say, but when you see a majority of the room doesn't really look like you and doesn't talk like you, specifically, you start to get the sense, like, you know, "I'm the minority." Most of them are probably correct. They're a lot older. So if you see the majority of the room look like that, you start to feel like, "I don't know if I wanna speak up and talk about what I believe is right," especially in a job setting.

Bryan: Yeah. That's absolutely true. I think I've definitely had the same thought. If we have greater diversity at the very top, at the C-suite level, we know that our goals are achievable, right? We wanna be...I know that I, at least, wanna be a great leader. And I also want other people to be like other generations that follow. I have a little sister, and she's going to college, so it's interesting. I want...in 10 years time, it's like, what will our society look like in the professional workplace? And I hope that in 10 years time that this is not a conversation that, you know, makes people uncomfortable. So I see right now, we're striving to make this a more equitable space for all. You know, that brings us to our own diversity. So why do you think diversity equity inclusion is important in the workplace?

Jayson: I think it's very important because it educates young people's...you know, their backgrounds and educate you on the, you know, religion. And so, you know, it teaches people respect for people's beliefs, which is huge.

Bryan: I agree. And I think our country right now is in such a interesting state, turning on the news, going on to Twitter and seeing these viral videos of how minorities are treated, recently with the attack on elderly Asians and across the country, because of COVID, obviously the black lives matter movement and how this happens, not just outside, but it also happens in the workplace professionally. And it's better to have these conversations now and create the dialogue and understand that, hey, we are here to create mutual respect with each other, learn from each other. And I think that's what you're bringing to the table here today, Jayson.

Jayson: Thank you, yeah. I hope I am.

Bryan: I think you are. So how does your unique identity make you a strong asset to the team, and how has it informed you professionally?

Jayson: Okay. I would say, okay, a unique identity. I think the first thing you would think it's, you know, visually. So, for me, obviously it's my long hair, I think, which is interesting, because I started growing out my hair in college, you know, like the typical college phase and people end up cutting it after, and I ended up keeping it because I just started to realize, like, for my identity, I like the long hair, because it somewhat associates with taking days, you know, one step at a time, relaxed, don't stress out too much. But at the same time, you know, I'm trying to bring this, you know, I guess, personality of mine, of being, you know, very nice, carefree, but, obviously, you know, be on top of your work. It's just like, I want the workplace to be more enjoyable.

If I'm gonna spend, you know, the rest of my life, per se...and not to make it sound bad like that, to be working, I wanna make sure it's enjoyable. I want people around me to be happy, you know? So I try to bring that positivity into our office just to make sure everyone feels good. Especially if any new hires, for example, I wanna make sure they're feeling welcomed. They just joined and the pandemic hit, hey, you know, and, like, they didn't even get to meet anyone. So it's a little scary for people, you know, to just join an office. You know, we wanna like one another, especially when you working.

Bryan: That's true. And I think, I mean, Jayson, you and Gary...Gary's our other coworker, and you guys made me feel really welcome.

Jayson: It's funny, though, because, actually, Gary was my college classmate.

Bryan: That's true.

Jayson: So for those of you...yes, for those that are listening, like, Gary is another cost consultant as well. But we were classmates in college. I mean, we got along so well, and I'm glad that he actually got the job as well.

Bryan: Yeah, he's really cool. And, honestly, I think, when I entered the office, I just thought, "Wow, this LA office is actually really diverse. And that tells me that there's so many different backgrounds here that I'm gonna be able to learn a lot from other people here." And from you, it was, you know, being welcoming, being chill and just having a laugh, you know, it was really cool. So, anyways, I really...I digress. So what advice would you give young people pursuing AEC careers who could be worried about facing discrimination or feeling like they're not adequate or have, like, the same thought that, you know, "I don't really see anyone that looks like me"? What would you say to them?

Jayson: I would say just to follow your passion. You know, I, myself, didn't have anyone to base my career on. You know, I didn't look to, like, my family or my friends. I didn't know anyone that was really following the path of the AEC industry. And so I thought to myself, you know, "You have to be that brave representative for those falling behind you." So, for example, in my high school, I could only remember, I think, one time there was an outreach, an engineer came by. And so I was very fascinated because, you know, I very into the math STEM field, but I really didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with my career. And no one really told me what to do.

And so after seeing this outreach of people that starts to look like me that are joining this industry, it made me start to broaden my path or, you know, field vision of, you know, maybe I can do this. And so, at the same time, you wanna make sure that, you know, the industry doesn't look like you, but doesn't mean you can't join it. And so by you joining it, you're setting an example for those behind you. Like, okay, the people look like me, and so you feel more comfortable. Like, it takes a lot of bravery to join these industries, but at the same time, you know, change won't just happen overnight. So you have to be the change you see.

Bryan: And if they join MGAC, they'll see us.

Jayson: Yeah. Let's make sure to know that I'm the one that brought you here. I'm just kidding.

Bryan: We kind of touched upon this earlier. In 10 years time, what do you think that our industry will look like?

Jayson: I mean, in 10 years time, I would like to see it be more diverse, but, you know, a lot of times, it's a slow change. If anything, I would like, you know, people in the industry to understand that you don't have to look a certain way, act or dress a certain way to get your point across. As long as you're professional, as long as you get your work done, that's pretty much all that matters. It shouldn't be based on your appearance.

Bryan: Yes, because that's a very superficial thing for someone to even get hung up on.

Jayson: Yeah, exactly.

Bryan: There's more to us than just this skin color or what we look like.

Jayson: Exactly. Exactly.

Bryan: I hope that in 10 years time, we are appreciated for what we're bringing to the table and that diversity becomes a normalized aspect in all companies. I know a lot of companies are trying to do that now with, like, advertising and marketing, but, in reality, I'm not sure if minorities are creating those marketing campaigns, but I hope that they are.

Jayson: Yeah, I agree. I completely agree with that.

Bryan: Speaking about our company, how would you bake DEI into MGAC's DNA?

Jayson: I would say, for the most part, the company as a whole, I think, is doing a wonderful job at that. We have, I would say, one of the most diverse companies I've seen in terms of the construction industry. And so that's a big start. And also, you know, our company is doing a lot of these DEI podcasts, and, like, you know, we have calendars, reminders talking about all these different ethnicities. And so I think for it to be baked into our DNA, it will take time. Obviously, talking to one another about it is the biggest thing. So I think that the path that we're going on right now with MGAC is great. You know, I hope to see in 10 years time, you know, it becomes even more diverse.

Bryan: Yeah. I agree. I think also has to do with their intention for hiring more diverse, unique people, which I believe that they are doing. And if you were establishing a company from the ground up, what would you do to ensure that DEI was central to the company's values?

Jayson: So, for me, I would say, okay, if I were to establish a company from the ground up, I would think, from the get-go, I would treat everyone equally. Especially equal pay, I would think, is a big thing, because there's a big gender pay gap and especially in the male-dominated construction industry. For me, if I were to start my company from the ground up, I'd make sure that everyone is paid the same, especially if they have the same education qualifications. I think that's all that really matters. Like, I'm just basing this back, you know, looking into my parents .My mom, she has a master's. My dad is not educated, but he has a job that actually pays a lot more than my mom, and she has her master's. I mean, it could be an industry thing, but I would want to make sure that everyone gets paid equally for the time of work and effort that they put.

Bryan: I agree with you. I mean, it's gonna take years for that divide to be closed up, but that would be an essential item for me. I just want equity to be at the forefront of any company. If I ever created one, if you ever created one for our generation, I want equity to be a foundational value.

Jayson: I agree. If we were to start a company, I wanna be the one that's actually at the forefront of that. You know, as an employee, if you know that your employer treats you well and takes care of you, that's how you retain your employees. You know, if they know that they're being taken care of or, you know, that, like, "Okay, well we'll keep low barring their pay until they actually ask for it." For the most part, it's like, when you respect your employees and you're paying them well, they won't wanna leave, for example, like Costco, right? Like, they're probably the top paid, you know, job for people that it's like right in...just high school. You know, you're just coming into the industry, and they pay really, really well. You treat your employees well, and they'll take care of the company.

The employees will start talking about, like, "I love this job. They treat me so well." And, you know, it shows a positive impact onto the company. I guess, talking back to MGAC, they've treated me so well, just coming straight out of college. And so I'm just happy to be a part of this company.

Bryan: Can you speak to increasing diversity and representation while avoiding tokenization?

Jayson: I mean, it's a tricky question because, obviously, the first couple, you know, people are like...I would say, like, if you were to hire a couple of people, right? And, like, you know, you wanna increase your diversity. They are obviously gonna be seen as, you know, the token X, Y, Z, right? To avoid tokenization, it's not just about employing an X, Y, Z. It's more of the intention of the employer. You know, they wanna make sure that they are seen and heard as an actual human being, not just like, "Okay, we have a number to pump our diversity up."

I think it all comes from top down, I guess. As long as the boss is saying, "We value them as an employee. They're a great asset to our company," I think that is fine. It's a slow process to bring more representation into the company. You know, it's small baby steps to get there. So I just think as long as the intent from the top down is to, you know, show that they are valued and they're cared for, then I think that's all that matters

Bryan: For some of our coworkers who may have never experienced, you know, discrimination...and this could be, you know, our JCs, our people that we work with on a day-to-day basis, what advice would you give them to be an ally?

Jayson: My advice would just be to be respectful for our coworkers, because it's hard enough for them to be joining an industry that doesn't represent them. And just to know that they are valued as an employee and that as long as they're doing their work, then that's all that matters.

Bryan: I would just think that people see something that's wrong or that's not really okay. You bring it up. You encourage a dialogue between others, encourage them to see that other person's point of view, to understand that some things bring pain to others. It brings back memories. And if someone is suffering and is going through these emotions, that's not a good place to be in a professional workplace. You know, there are a lot of our coworkers who have never faced discrimination. There are a lot of white men who have had such a privilege in their life. You know, what's interesting is, my boyfriend, he's white, and he really tries to understand where I'm coming from as a Latino who is gay. And he, I mean, he's obviously gay, but there's just discrimination that he's never faced before. When we have our conversations, he does his best to understand, you know, "I actually have been very, very privileged, and I'm gonna do my best to ensure that I'm not saying things that are gonna make people uncomfortable."

And if you do see something and it's wrong, you speak up and you let them know, "Hey, you cannot say stuff like that." I know that older generations may say phrases here and there, but it's important to communicate to others that in order to be an ally, you need to understand where that person who is a minority, where they're coming from, what their background is, and then be cognizant of the fact that your words matter. Communication matters between people. So I would say that if you wanna be an ally, you have to extend your hand to the other person and really try to have that communication and common ground with them.

Jayson: I totally agree.

Bryan: You know, Jayson, it's been really great speaking with you. I hope that people, when they're listening to this, they understand that, you know, you and I come from diverse background. We come from melting pot cities, and it's helped us in our perspectives, in our careers. And I hope that, you know, moving forward, that we normalize diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. So, I mean, I appreciate you coming on and speaking your thoughts and letting our listeners know more about yourself.

Jayson: Thank you, Bryan. It was a pleasure being on this.

Bryan: Thank you for listening to this episode of ''MGAC Inner Voices.'' Come back next month, and we'll have another episode for you. Thanks, everyone.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC is excited to share that our Toronto office has moved to a new Downtown location. Last month, we opened the doors to <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-on-the-move-mgac-toronto-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our new Canadian office</a> located in Sterling Junction, one of Toronto’s most vibrant up-and-coming neighborhoods.

“Sterling Junction has such a great energy and a culture-rich atmosphere that perfectly complements our team culture. The work being done in this area is exciting and having an office here enables us to be more easily connected to our clients in Toronto and beyond,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/isabella-villegas/89" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabella Villegas</a>, Vice President at MGAC.

Built in 1930, the office building was originally home to an industrial transformer factory. Over the years, the larger space has housed a wide range of tenants, and today, our neighbors include artists, photographers, architects, digital studios, and coffee roasters. We will be well connected within Toronto and beyond with the subway, GO train, and UP Express just to the north and the College and Dundas streetcars to the south.

“This move and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/isabella-villegas-joins-mgac-as-a-vice-president-of-project-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the addition of Isabella’s leadership</a> last year builds on our commitment to continue providing project management, cost management, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional services</a> to the Toronto area and throughout Canada,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Anderson</a>, Founder and President of MGAC. “Over the years, we have become known for our innovative, forward-thinking approach to our work, and much of Toronto is experiencing enormous growth. It is exciting to follow the work of our team here, and this new footprint creates even more potential for that team as it continues to take on some of Canada’s most challenging and interesting projects.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://ers.corenetglobal.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoreNet Eastern Regional Symposium</a> (ERS) is an annual event hosted by six of the northeast chapters of <a href="https://www.corenetglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoreNet Global</a>. The organization is a non-profit focused on advancing the practice of corporate real estate through conferences, research, and networking opportunities, among other things. This year’s event is taking place on May 17th, and MGAC is proud to be a sponsor.

The 2021 conference theme is “Reframe the Future,” and the agenda is centered around emerging trends for cities, workplaces, and people. CoreNet developed this focus in response to a year that has brought so many new changes and challenges for the industry, and the sessions will be geared toward helping companies successfully meet this moment and those still to come.

Three members of our team will be attending virtually this year. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/erin-figueroa/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Figueroa</a>, who serves on CoreNet’s Mid-Atlantic Chapter Board, will be in attendance and will be joined by <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/christopher-perruna/96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Perruna</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/kristina-leighty/92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristina Leighty</a>. We encourage our colleagues in the industry to consider attending—information and sign-ups can be found <a href="https://ers.corenetglobal.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>—and we hope to see you in the virtual networking sessions!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last summer, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) finalized the purchase of the former Newseum building at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, DC, a future site of a collaboration and learning hub for JHU. MGAC’s project team gave us a tour of the renovations that are underway to convert the property from a museum to a state-of-the-art university facility.

&nbsp;

The original structure is an extremely intricate and custom-tailored building to accommodate for the former Newseum’s open program and flow of visitors. Over the past few months, the project team has installed roughly 148 tons of steel bracing and reinforcement to hold the building together while the columns, shear walls, and slabs are reconfigured. The latest concrete application techniques in conjunction with carbon dioxide capture technology is being used to increase cure strength and reduce environmental footprint.

&nbsp;

The 555 building had staircases that spanned its massive atrium. The original building was designed to channel the course of former Newseum visitors in a programmatic flow. As the team prepares the building to accept the new program for JHU, the stairs have been cut out and lowered to the ground floor for removal. The new atrium will be even larger with 9 stories and will feature “floating” classrooms.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-walters-a436311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Walters</a>, Vice President at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Hi Jerry, welcome to the blog! Tell us what you do at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Jerry Walters (JW): </strong>I’m a Vice President within the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?market_ids%5B%5D=10">Hospitality Team</a>. I’m based in our Washington, DC office, but I get to manage hotel renovations and new builds for clients across the country.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how long have you been with the company?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>It will be 11 years this September!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> <strong>Nice! What were you doing before you came here?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Before MGAC, I worked for a real estate developer and a general contractor. Immediately prior to coming on board, I was in a consulting role for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I thought it would be more construction- and project-related. But it was my first foray into government work, and as it turned out, was much more focused on analysis and planning. As someone who enjoys being more hands-on and moving projects forward, I quickly figured out it wasn’t for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Let’s go back a little farther. What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>When I was a kid, I thought being an architect would be cool. But, as I got older and got more interested in math and science, I felt less inclined toward that artistic side of the built environment. Ultimately, I studied civil engineering in college—so I was always operating in this arena.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What would that kid think about your current job today?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I think kid-me would think it’s pretty cool getting to see projects come together. What’s always attracted me to the industry is that you’re actually building something. You’re putting that real, concrete <em>something</em> in place.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What keeps you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I just wrapped up the renovation of the <a href="https://www.hamiltonhoteldc.com/">Hamilton Hotel</a> in Washington, DC. It’s in a great location right in the heart of town on K Street. Incorporated in the work is the Schuyler event venue. For years, the hotel had used a neighboring property’s large ballroom as its de facto large ballroom space. The new owner of the hotel was able to forge an agreement for exclusive use of the ballroom, now dubbed the Schuyler. As part of the renovation, we were able to create a new interior connection between it and the hotel. It took some coordination to figure out how to build that entrance between the two buildings—and more broadly, to renovate a space that hadn’t been renovated since probably the 1980s. It was a significant transformation.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How interesting! With that project wrapped, what’s ahead?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I’m also currently working on the planning for a major renovation to a hotel, beach club, and country club in Delray Beach, Florida. It’s an unbranded property—which means there’s a lot more flexibility in what we can do. The owner is really excited about the transformation. We’re planning to build a model room out in May, and that will kick off the guestroom renovation, which will happen after their busy season in 2022.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>You mentioned the impacts on hospitality work during the pandemic. What comes next?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>That’s the million-dollar question! Everyone is trying to figure out what happens next and where things are going.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What are your takeaways?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>The last year obviously brought huge disruptions to hospitality. Hotels didn't have much business; many closed or scaled back their offerings. I think things are starting to open up more now. We’re seeing that drive-to resort destinations are extremely busy. I think the bigger challenge is the downtown properties and big convention properties with a decline in business travel. I think owners who are going to be successful with those properties are rethinking how their properties can be used. For example, creating new leisure activities to draw guests in. And really getting people comfortable with the ways they’re adapting, such as showcasing their safe cleaning procedures and opportunities for guests to safely distance. This industry has always been one where the details matter—and that is going to be especially true in the months ahead.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Safe to say this is one of the biggest work challenges you’ve faced in your time at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Absolutely. I joined in 2010. By then, the 2008 / 2009 recession was ending, and things had been relatively healthy from then until now. This has certainly been one of the biggest challenges I’ve encountered in my career.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How has it affected the way you approach your work?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>The biggest is just the need to be flexible and nimble. Both in terms of taking on more work and potentially different roles than you have in the past, and in being willing to approach a project from a different perspective than you would in a “normal” circumstance. It’s about expecting the unexpected—because the impacts keep coming, sometimes from places you wouldn't anticipate. As for relationships with clients, it’s made me even more intentional about opening those lines of communication and making sure that, if anything, we’re over-communicating. Because things are changing quickly, we want to ensure all the information is shared and folks aren’t caught off guard. Ultimately, these aren’t fundamental changes to the way our team operates—we’ve always been both adaptable and highly communicative—but we want to make sure we’re totally on point and ready to react to whatever is thrown at us.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely—it’s critical to be ahead of that curve! What impact do you hope to have here at MGAC?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>It boils down to delivering really good projects for our clients at the end of the day. Ensuring we’re providing the best service we can and delivering above and beyond what the client would ever expect. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is seeing people come together to pull off a project and I try to lead by example in forging that team-based attitude.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And when it comes to client relationships?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I try to serve as a mediator. A lot of these projects get complicated. I think it’s our job as project manager to make the work as simple for the client to understand as possible. There may be all these complex things happening in the background, but we can boil it down to a simple, straightforward evaluation of the issue so the owner can understand it and make the decisions that need to be made to move the project forward without getting too bogged down in the weeds.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I enjoy handing the ‘keys’ over to the final product and seeing the look on a client’s face. I think that’s what continues to draw me to the industry: being able to change a place in such a way that will have a positive impact on a community. I've worked on projects where you transform a run-down building or a vacant lot—and it’s equally transformative to that place. It's exciting to have that experience, both professionally and personally.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Speaking of community impact, you’re quite involved with the <a href="https://uli.org/">Urban Land Institute</a> (ULI). What’s that organization all about?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>It’s a professional organization focused on the built environment. It’s headquartered in Washington, DC, but has chapters across the country and even some international branches. It provides members (who are planning and design professionals, project managers, land-use attorneys, really anyone who touches the built environment) with opportunities for education, networking, and other resources.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What are some specific ways you’ve gotten involved?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I’ve been in a program for mid-career professionals called NEXT for five to six years now. We meet in small groups every other month to discuss a topic related to the field. Sometimes, we’ll bring a speaker in or go on a building tour. For instance, this year, my group has been talking about new energy conservation laws coming online in New York City and Washington, DC and how they may impact both new construction and existing buildings. I’ve also participated in ULI’s leadership program, a yearlong program that involves meeting once a month for a full day with the intent of helping you develop your leadership skills.<strong> </strong>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What an incredible resource! Looking back on your decade-plus with the company, what at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>The value of relationships. A lot of our work is repeat business—particularly in the hospitality environment. It’s a lot of the same contractors, owners, and designers you’re working with over and over again. So, it’s key to not only establish relationships, but to maintain them over time.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Having people I can depend on. When you have a team that will support you—whether at work or at home—anything is possible.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I wish I had a magic answer to that! I’d say spending time with my family, having dinner together and generally, relaxing at home. That’s really what works for me. I also try to find time to get outside. That’s helped a lot in the past year, in particular.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Coffee. It’s the first thing I do. And nothing special, just a Keurig machine!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I read a book a couple of years ago called <em>A Walk in the Woods</em>. The writer, Bill Bryson, had the notion he was going to walk the Appalachian Trail all the way through. I’d always had the same thought: “Maybe when I'm older, I’ll hike the entire Appalachian Trail.” (I can tell you, after reading the book, I don’t think I’ll ever be a through-hiker. It’s not for me!) But what I took from the book is that he’s this middle-aged guy who really didn’t have any place being on the Appalachian Trail. He hadn’t trained for it enough or done the level of research he should have. But still, he persevered. Ultimately, it’s about the fact that you can always do more than you think you can do. And it’s all told in a fun way—it’s a great read.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>One of my roommates in college was also an engineering student. It’s a difficult course of study, with a lot of work. We would often say, “With each day, there’s new hope”—kind of as a joke. But as a project manager, I’ve realized that’s an important perspective to have. You’ll be in the midst of a project when you encounter an issue, or things don’t go the way you planned. I think the takeaway is you have a chance each day to make it right. You need to have that confidence that you’ll work through it. It took me a long time to really understand that.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong> <strong>Such a good point! Now, how about a few rapid-fire questions?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Okay!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Delivering for clients, always.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Check my to-do list. I usually make one list that I update throughout the week.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's the last thing?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Review my schedule for the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>An extension cord, for when I’m traveling. They come in handy in the airport. Of course, I haven’t been traveling as much lately, but traditionally hospitality projects have me traveling a lot. So, I’m always prepared.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Probably the Message app, or Hangouts from Google. I have two kids—ages 9 and 14—so that’s how my wife and I are keeping track of them.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What does the rest of 2021 look like for you?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>Like everyone, just trying to prepare for what comes next. Figuring out how things are going to shake out as we near the end of COVID-19—or learn to live with COVID-19, whatever it may be. That’s both in the workplace and in terms of what our next projects are going to look like. I’m confident our team can tackle the projects. But knowing what they are going to be and, more generally, how the hospitality industry is going to react to where we are—those are still big questions.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I’d like to take on more leadership roles and really be able to help shape the future of MGAC. I think that would be really exciting. I’ve been here 10 years and the company has grown tremendously, both in the number of people we have on staff full-time and office locations. When I joined, we did have our office in Seattle, but that was it. Now we have offices in Los Angeles, Toronto, and elsewhere. The growth has truly been dramatic.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>JW: </strong>I’m a pretty good cook! And I like to make cocktails. Manhattan’s, in particular, are my favorite. I’m subscribed to Shaker &amp; Spoon, a monthly subscription service that sends you the ingredients to make three cocktails. One of my brothers and a friend also get the subscription and each month, we get together—either in person or on Zoom—to make the drinks and spend time together.

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-casey-pmp-b39851101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Casey</a> gives us a tour of the new modernized Eliot-Hine Middle School in Washington, DC.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hi. This is Alex Casey, project manager with MGAC. Today, I'm here at Eliot-Hine Middle School, our project with the D.C. Department of General Services. Let's get moving.</em>

<em>The school site enhancement project includes two basketball courts, baseball and soccer fields, making up over 2 acres of public space to be used by the community and the school. The new library is in what used to be the school's gym. This new, more modern space includes separate breakout rooms for students and staff. The renovation of the middle school's historic auditorium included custom millwork and plaster throughout, as well as technological upgrades to facilitate the school's state-of-the-art theater and music programs.</em>

<em>Hope you enjoyed seeing what's happening at Eliot-Hine Middle School. Follow us to see MGAC's next move.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At MGAC, our success has always been rooted in the uniquely talented, creative, and experienced members of our team. That success starts with outstanding leadership, and we are happy to announce the addition of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/gail-borthwick/99" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gail Borthwick</a> as our newest Vice President for Commercial and Development Strategy in Toronto. Gail comes to MGAC with over 20 years of experience having worked in architecture, urban design, and sustainable design. Over the course of her academic and professional career, she has worked and lived in Canada, the United States, and Scotland.

“At MGAC, we are always looking for leaders who bring unique perspectives and experiences to the team. We have certainly found that in Gail,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O’Connor</a>, Managing Director at MGAC. “She has done hands-on architectural and city development work, has led teams at some of the most widely recognized firms in the business, and approaches her work with a sharp business analysis mindset. Her wide-ranging projects and global experience will be invaluable in the greater Toronto area, which is so extraordinarily diverse and forward-looking on the development front.”

Gail joins the firm just as MGAC’s Toronto team <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgacs-toronto-team-moves-to-new-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has expanded its footprint</a> by opening the doors to a new Downtown Toronto office. “Helping to grow teams and team capabilities is the kind of work I really love, and it is an exciting time to come in and do that at MGAC,” says Gail. “Having worked with some of the Toronto team in the past, I know what this group is capable of. On top of that, there is so much happening on the building front in our region, which will only bring more exciting opportunities over the months to come. I am truly humbled and thrilled to be a part of that journey.”

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our Critical Environment projects.</em>
<h4><strong>Perfect Timing</strong></h4>
In the late 1990s, there was a “dot-com bubble.” Internet startups proliferated. For every Amazon that got going, there were four or five www.pets.com. GoDaddy ads were the talk of the office. WorldCom and Global Crossing quickly became international powerhouses in the telecommunications space. Colocation companies built globally were seeing the massive demand for mission-critical space. Redundancy, resiliency, and security were the buzzwords of the moment.

Then somehow, the bubble burst. Maybe people got ahead of themselves. There was no more www.pets.com, WorldCom, or Global Crossing. The NASDAQ fell 78% from its peak quickly. That would be equivalent to an 11,000-point drop from today’s level. We heard “the world has built its last data center.” Those in the industry postulated that the capacity in place would be enough support needed for the foreseeable future.

It was in that market, and amid this rapidly changing landscape, that MGAC began its <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/critical-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Critical Environments</a> (CE) Group.
<h4><strong>Tracking Exponential Growth—Math Books Optional</strong></h4>
Rates of ascent can be linear, or alternatively, can be exponential. What starts slowly takes off in an exponential growth model. COVID-19 infection rates are a timely, commonly understood example of this. MGAC’s Critical Environment’s Group took that exponential route from the jump. Carefully cultivated relationships and a history of delivering successful projects led MGAC to be awarded Fannie Mae’s Urbana Technology Campus. A 125,000 SF resilient post-9/11 office building, and a new data center to support Fannie Mae’s corporate requirements.

Our first large, ground-up data center was cutting edge. Many of the details are private, but the project was recognized publicly as the world’s first LEED certified data center. It was an exciting and highly involved endeavor and the relationships built during that time last to this day.

Exponential growth means the first engenders two, two engenders four, and so on. That led us to Highmark Inc., whose first data center marked the beginning of a decade’s long collaboration between Highmark and MGAC as needs arose. The project, located on an admittedly “challenging site” (which translated means a ravine), became the world’s first LEED Gold certified data center. Quick on the heels of that project, a paired data center program was undertaken for a Fortune 500 industrial giant in the Midwest, which entailed constructing the same building on two sites—45 miles apart.

Immediately following, a major banking client fired its failing project management team from a national brokerage firm and brought MGAC in to rescue the project. Rationalizing size, putting in place a process to deliver, and ultimately building the project in a remote location in Ontario, Canada spawned MGAC Canada ULC, MGAC’s Canadian subsidiary. The project was uniformly successful under our leadership, was LEED Gold certified, and features the largest solar photovoltaic array in Ontario.

From there, our exponential trajectory continued. We completed project after project, and so on.
<h4><strong>Still Growing—Today, Tomorrow</strong></h4>
Somehow building $500M data centers in 24 months or less has become normal, if not routine. MGAC has an unblemished record of delivering these projects. Thirty megawatts of critical power, delivered in six months from groundbreaking? We have done it. National program for distributed data delivery? We have done it.

Much of the work we have done in this space is understandably under non-disclosure agreements, but every project comes back to the same fundamentals. Critical Environments and mission-critical projects are about predictability, speed to delivery, value for the investment, and confidence—the kinds of assurances and outcomes we built MGAC to deliver. To date, our CE team consists of 22 people working across 11 states and Canada, working for many of the world’s major technology companies, delivering their mission-critical facilities on time and within budget.]]></content:encoded>

We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timmcgarvey9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim McGarvey</a>, Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Welcome to the Impact Blog, Tim! Tell us about your role at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Tim McGarvey (TM): </strong>I’m a Project Manager in our San Francisco office. Much of my time is spent on client projects: I’m going out to construction job sites, running client meetings, solving technical problems, and planning. But we’re also a growing group here in San Francisco, so a good portion of my time is also focused on Business Development and growing the team here. It’s exciting to be able to work on both of those things simultaneously.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Nice! And how long have you been on board? </strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I started in January. It’s been an interesting time to join due to the pandemic. But it’s been a great first several months here and I’ve been able to meet many of my colleagues across the country remotely.
<strong>
<span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What kind of work were you doing before? </strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I cut my teeth working for General Contractors (GC) up and down the Peninsula and San Francisco Bay Area. I spent quite a few years doing big ground-up corporate campus projects for large technology companies in California, including Intuit's Global Headquarters in Mountain View and a well-known confidential technology company in Cupertino.

From there, I moved into the tenant improvement world, working mostly with technology companies in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. It was a good change of pace. It really rounded out my experience to transition from long-term, slower-moving projects to fast-paced, quick-turnaround projects for growing companies where timeline was the most important thing. That work also involved managing multiple projects at the same time, so I learned to juggle different project deadlines and navigate various client personalities.

In my next role, I worked on the owner’s side—one of the clients I was building projects for as a GC brought me in to work directly for them. My time there really brought my experience full circle. When you’re working on the owner’s side of the table, you see how the sausage is made, so to speak. You understand how internal politics work—those relationships and dynamics clients deal with that may not always be as immediately obvious to contractors and project managers. Today, I’m able to approach projects with that experience in mind.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Quite the well-rounded background! And what brought you to MGAC? </strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I was seeking a position that matched my skill set and interest in the consulting / owner’s representative world. The stars aligned when I found MGAC. It was virtually an immediate fit. I got along well with everyone I talked to, and the range of project types and client-centric approach were a great match for my personal work style.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Now that you’re a part of the team, what fresh perspectives are you hoping to bring to the table? </strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I think my perspective from working on the owner’s side combined with the technical experience from the GC world is unique. Having that awareness and understanding and being able to speak to the types of problems and situations I faced in my time on that side of the table, will be invaluable.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely. Safe to say you probably didn’t always plan to follow this path—what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Well, I thought I was going to be a professional baseball player until I was about 13 and I stopped growing! And true, I didn’t know a Construction Manager, or even a General Contractor, existed as a kid. But I always enjoyed building things—be it something for a science fair or messing around with Roller Coaster Tycoon. I liked having something to show for my work at the end of the day. I’ve also always been involved in team sports and thrived in a team atmosphere. And this role, to me, really is a true team sport. There could be 20 vendors working on a project and you’re at the center of it, coordinating technical issues while managing different skill sets and personalities. Ultimately, you have to figure out how to successfully navigate all of those elements to get the job done. So, looking back, it would make sense to fall into something like this—but it was an interesting journey to get here.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Tell us about it!</strong>

<strong>TM:</strong> In college, I started out as a Computer Science major. I liked the problem-solving aspect, but it involved too much time at a computer and not enough time interacting with people and getting out and actually building things. From there, I transferred into City Planning. That was a little bit closer and more hands-on, but was still such hypothetical long-term planning. However, those courses ultimately gave me exposure to real estate development, general contractors, and this world of building. You could say I meandered my way into it!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What do you think your younger self would think about your current job today?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>He’d think it’s pretty cool. Going out to the job sites, seeing all the equipment out there. And having something to show for all your hard work. It’s cool to drive down the highway and point out projects to people, telling them about the challenges and triumphs along the way.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>You mentioned you wanted to play baseball professionally as a kid. What’s your team? </strong>

<strong>TM:</strong> The Oakland A’s. It’s not such a popular thing to say around here with so many Giants fans! But I’ve been a fan since day one. I grew up in the East Bay, we’d take the BART train out to the Oakland Coliseum every summer.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What keeps you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I’m working with a confidential biotechnology client. It’s pretty technical on the project level. My client purchases a lot of proprietary equipment overseas or will just build it themselves. It’s my job to figure out how that equipment will come together in the building, even what type of building or structure is needed. There’s also a permitting side to the work, ensuring City and County regulations, chemical inventories, and health and safety protocols are followed. And I’m in the process of helping them move one of their laboratories out of state to the Research Triangle area in North Carolina. It’s been an interesting process, because I have a strong network of contractors, architects, etc. in the Bay Area, but I’m now spending much of my time working with our East Coast teams to meet and interview firms in that region. I’m working to ensure everything goes smoothly as we bring the client into a new market—while managing everything remotely.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how are things going with the San Francisco office? </strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>That’s actually my other major focus: big-picture growth for the San Francisco office. I’m looking at getting new work and trying to enter new market segments. Like so many places, the commercial office market in San Francisco has been slow for a year and a half due to the pandemic, so a lot of building owners and clients are trying to pivot in the way they’re using space. We’re working to be ahead of the curve in giving them recommendations on what other companies are doing, what the market is doing, and what the area is going to look like in the future.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>The pandemic has obviously presented its own set of challenges, including, for me, onboarding into a new role remotely. But something I noticed right off—and really appreciate—is how MGAC operates as one company, a continuation of all the different offices together. Every single day, I’m talking to people in DC, LA, Seattle. The offices are truly an extension of one another. It really made a potentially difficult situation of getting to know everyone and getting up to speed much easier.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s great. Thinking beyond day-to-day work, what larger impact do you hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I’d like to leave every single project I work on, everything we interview for, and everyone I’m meeting while out and about with a positive impression of who we are. I want to be an advocate for the company and leave a good impression that we're doing things the right way.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>At the end of the day, I really appreciate having a finished product to show for my work and stories to tell. Every project has its challenges, but ultimately there’s just one goal, and that’s to get the project done and get the client into the building. Being able to get to that finish line and create bonds and relationships with people along the way has been really rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s so true. Taking a step back, how do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I’ve always liked to work on landmark projects. Most of those I've done in my career have a story attached to them, and they provide something to the community that hasn’t been there before. I think MGAC’s resume is a lot like that; we're very strategic in the work we take on. We don’t build cookie-cutter buildings for sub-par developers. We’re choosing projects that provide an impact and leave stories to tell. Projects that leave a positive impact on the community.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Well said! And what at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Everyone just does the right thing. There’s a lot of transparency in the way that the people of MGAC go about business. They put the project first, period. It’s really refreshing, because it’s how I've always operated as well.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Difficult problems give me energy. I like to keep my plate pretty full with challenging tasks.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>How do you wind down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Watching baseball. I like having it on in the background. It’s a nice, slow pace to end the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And what’s your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I try to solve big problems first—with a cup of coffee in hand. Getting those out of the way gives me momentum to move through the rest of the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I read pretty frequently; I try to read 15-20 books a year. As it applies to my work, I like <em>The 80/20 Principle</em>. It’s about leveraging your time. For example, 80 percent of the work you accomplish is done through 20 percent of your time. Or, in a company, 80 percent of the sales are from 20 percent of the products. So, it’s about finding the high-leverage parts of your work and trying to focus on what’s truly important—that 20 percent—so you can get things done more efficiently.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>“Pressure is a privilege.” It’s the title of a book by Billie Jean King. I like the perspective it offers. Whenever something feels overwhelming because there are a lot of expectations, it’s important to remember that you earned the right to be able to have that. Your experiences along the way put you in the position to feel that pressure. And if you weren’t doing something important, you wouldn't be experiencing it.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Great one! What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I think it’s pretty simple: That I went about my business in the right way, and that people liked working with me. That’s what I try to do on a daily basis.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Are you ready for a few rapid-fire questions?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Sure!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Solving complicated problems for clients.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Drink coffee.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And the last thing?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Answer all my emails and clear the inbox before the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your work bag?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I am pretty minimalist. It’d be the essentials only: my computer, charger, and mouse.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to workweek lunch?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>I'll go with a deli sandwich. Smoked turkey on Dutch Crunch (a bread staple in the Bay Area).

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Google Maps. I’m in there a lot. I love being the navigator of the group. And I enjoy just exploring it to know the context and orientation of where we are while driving.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's your biggest work goal for 2021?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>My main, time-sensitive goal is to relocate my client to North Carolina and get them moved in. In a more open-ended sense, it’s also a goal to continue to grow the group in San Francisco and make good progress on our Business Development efforts.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>In a leadership position at MGAC, growing and managing a team while leading Operations and Business Development efforts.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>TM: </strong>Maybe that I’m a baseball encyclopedia. I’d go toe-to-toe with anyone on baseball stats and general knowledge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/luxury-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Living</a> projects.</em>

Design and construction projects are, by definition, a quest for the optimum relationship of four variables: time, money, labor, and resources. Imagine for a moment you had unbounded capital and access to whatever labor and materials required for your project, but still find yourself frustrated by continuously late and misguided project outcomes. That frustration—a relatively common one—is what led MGAC to the Luxury Living sector and initiated ongoing work aimed at helping high-net-worth families realize their building ambitions.

MGAC’s work in this space started 15 years ago when we were contacted by the family office of a global business leader. In their professional lives, new products made world headlines, and were released at precisely the moment promised to great fanfare and press. In their private lives, despite every resource available, personal projects remained a source of frustration. Our team was commissioned to bring our commercial project management skills and expertise to oversee and ensure the delivery of several family construction projects.

This growing work ultimately led to the establishment of our Seattle office in 2006. As with many of our other projects, our involvement in managing this one family’s facility design and construction needs was significant. Every MGAC employee at the time was dedicated to this project that consisted of renovating not only their main residence, but also weekend getaway homes, and remote properties.

At MGAC, our growth has always stemmed from our reputation and through word-of-mouth. As it happens, one family speaks to the next, and our Seattle Luxury Living practice soon grew to serve another family and spread geographically from the Midwest to the East Coast with significant projects in Chicago, New York, New England, and Washington, DC.

Our team has never shied away from a challenge, and the promise of a challenge comes with the territory in this sector. These clients keep full schedules—often mapped out 12 to 18 months in advance—comprised of near-constant business, philanthropic, and personal events. This takes the possibility of any kind of typical design and construction decision making process—which often includes impromptu meetings, jobsite visits, and lengthy interactions with project teams—off the table.

To cater to these needs, we developed a means and method for communicating with clients we may rarely have the opportunity to meet face-to-face, who often task us with protecting very private interests, and who require the ongoing support of a partner who can act on their behalf. This adjusted approach and proactive expectation setting extends not only to the client, but to the various teams contracted for the project—everyone from architects to designers to builders and engineers who might be more accustomed to a closer client relationship.

All of these projects are in and of themselves unique, posing extraordinary challenges in sourcing materials, securing just the right labor, and meeting unparalleled quality expectations. Creating a four story-spiral staircase for a private library from a single sheet of 1-inch-by-72-inch steel twisted into a corkscrew is, needless to say, not a typical task. Chartering a jumbo jet to bring that steel from its fabricator to the jobsite is not something done every day, but something we have executed successfully for clients.

Working for several years to install an undersea cable to carry power and fiber optic connectivity to a private island is uniquely satisfying. Moving a state highway and building a new overpass to shift a public highway further from our client’s home? We have done it. Globally sourcing and carving stone blocks to form a free-floating, curved, multi-story staircase? Almost as commonplace in Luxury Living as finding and relocating 40-ton boulders to form a diving rock for a granite-lined swimming pool.

The joy of these projects is in meeting our client’s expectations and creating a level of surprise with “I wasn’t sure if this could really be done,” and “this is even better than I’d imagined.” Sixteen years and nearly $1B in luxury homes later, we remain focused on meeting—and exceeding—client expectations every time. Bring on the next challenge.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, and welcome to another episode of "MGAC Inner Voices." A podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, and the architecture, engineering, construction industry. As I've noted before, we wanna preface this podcast by letting you know that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wanna share our stories and discuss how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond.

I'm Bryan Gamez, project manager at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today I have the great privilege of speaking with Uzair Faruqui. He has been working alongside me for the past year and a half, but I'd like to let him introduce himself.

Uzair: Thanks, Bryan. I'm Uzair Faruqui, I've been with MGAC for about three and a half actually coming up on four years. I'm a Senior Project Manager. I'm also based in Los Angeles and my professional background. I studied civil and structural engineering at the University of Southern California. While I was in school, I actually was hired as an intern by a construction company here in Los Angeles same one that Bryan used to work at prior to him coming over from USC.

So, MATT Construction hired me as an intern and I was an intern for about 18 months through one summer. And then all through the next school year, which was my junior year. I was an onsite intern at the Natural History Museum project between the summer of my junior year and my senior year. I went up to Oregon and worked for Hoffman Construction, which is another general contractor, a pretty large general contractor in the Portland area. They're pretty well known in the Pacific Northwest.

I came back and this is 2009 when I came back to USC for my senior year and the recession was in full swing. And my intern position, at the general contractor, that project was still ongoing it was about a five or six-year multi-phase project, had been filled with a full-time employee. So I went over to the adjacent trailer which was occupied by the owner representative which was a company called Cordell Corporation. It was a two-man operation at the time with a president and kind of an administrative coordinator.

And I went over and I said to this gentleman, his name is Don Webb. And so I just popped into his trailer one day and he waved me, he was on a phone call. He said, "Hold on, I wanted to talk to you." And he finished up his phone call and he called me in and in so many words he says, "They can't hire you, next door. They can't take on any interns because of the recession. Why don't you come work for me instead?" So I started by filing papers, filing RFIs, submittals, reviewing pay applications. And slowly ended up becoming partners with this gentleman. And stayed with them for about six years on side of the Natural History Museum, management my whole general contracting company, and that's essentially where I cut my teeth.

I did a quick stint at another project management firm for about three years doing facility master planning. And healthcare-related strategic planning for the repositioning of hospitals. So it really taught me about the front-end of projects, which I wasn't as used to rather than the actual construction design side of it. And then I joined MGAC, probably about 2016. And I've been there ever since.

Bryan: I did not know that you had been managing the Natural History Project. So it's interesting.

Uzair: Yeah, it was a pretty fun gig. I mean, that project went for five to six years. We touched every single part of that museum. There was every type of project within that project that you could imagine. There was landscaping, exhibit fabrication, exhibit design, seismic retrofit, MEP upgrades. We did a new central plant, administrative offices, we built a parking garage. I mean, you name it, we did it on that campus, and was a pretty fun project and we capped it off with a $13 million glass pavilion.

Bryan: Beautiful.

Uzair: And there's a whale skeleton which is hanging in that pavilion with an LED backdrop and ceiling. So that was kind of like the jewel box at the end. And there was a big party in 2013 when the Natural History Museum celebrated its centennial. It had been open for 100 years at that point.

Bryan: And to all our listeners, if you ever had the chance you should visit this beautiful jewel box in Los Angeles. So Uzair can you please tell us more about your identity and your background?

Uzair: Yeah, sure. So I am Pakistani-American. My parents...I was born and raised in the U.S., but my parents are Pakistani, both of them. I grew up traveling back to Pakistan every winter for about, like, the first seven, eight years of my life. And then it came to every other summer for like the next couple years. And then it was like every four summers.

So you know, being Pakistan is part of my identity. I did grow up in a fairly, I would say, like, an upper-middle-class suburb of Portland, Oregon. And I'd say Portland is not really well known for its diversity. So I was one of probably four like I just say brown, but brown kids in my high school. You know, it's the majority of, you know, white kids. We had a handful of Korean kids, we have a small Korean population in Oregon.

But yeah, in terms of, you know, being, you know, our color, there was only a handful of or us. But yeah, being Pakistani was a large part of my identity. But, you know, Portland's a fairly, fairly friendly place, and even the suburbs, they were fairly nice to me growing up.

Bryan: Right, I understand what you're saying. I mean, I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, DC, with fairly a white population but being Latino you know, there's a handful of brown kids that are out in the suburbs. But still friendly, but they're still, you know, sort of an impact, to who I become as a person being in that environment. How do you think that your identity has affected you in a professional setting, Uzair?

Uzair: Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting, you know, when I first started as an intern at the general contractor, I don't think it was very common for the construction team, especially the superintendents to be working with somebody of non-American or non-Caucasian.

So I think, you know, the majority of the trades at the time, and the majority of the management on site. And, you know, my first couple months at a construction site, were in a trailer at another museum. And, you know, our onsite staff was mostly American. We had one Latino project...we had two Latino project engineers, but you know, the superintendents were both, you know, white. And, of course, the field team was, you know, a mix between white, Latino, and a little bit of African-American.

So I think it was interesting for them, to see a brown kid in the office. And, you know, one of the things which I think is interesting is that you know, Pakistanis can come in a range of different colors. We can come in light, we can come in dark. I have fairly dark skin. Part of that is because we live in Southern California, and I love being in the sun. So I think I, you know, stand out as a darker person. But yeah, I think it was interesting and that was the first push of non-white people managing the project.

And I was kind of like the first generation of non-Caucasians managing projects. And I think that you know, Latinos had kind of come into that role a couple of years, five years before me, maybe five years before I started to. And now you see, the whole industry has completely shifted, and there's people of all colors and genders and, you know, identities in project management and being in the trailer.

Bryan: Yeah, and I think a part of that has to be with more people pursuing careers in the industry. And I have to agree with you that there are more and more handful of people of color in the industry. But I still think that we have a long ways to go in terms of diversity in this industry in and of itself.

Uzair: But I think, you know, part of the reason why the shift hadn't fully taken place was, if you look at, let's just take Pakistani, Indian, Asian-Americans, for example. Into you know, they typically immigrated and there, you know, we're usually first or second generation. So our parents typically come with a technical background, but a lot of us have technical backgrounds. For instance, like, there's a lot of engineers who are Pakistani, or there's a lot of Asian-American engineers. And as a result, they stayed in their engineering fields.

I was raised. And this is just a fun anecdote. Both, my grandfathers were civil engineers, my dad was an industrial system and mechanical engineer, and I'm, you know, I studied civil engineering. So I was raised and had kind of an engineering background, always, you know, the little bit of engineering influence is always going on. But when I went to school, you know, I was accepted and pushed into other paths other than being a designer, being a civil and structural engineer, being an MEP designer.

And so I think that that shift in the generation with, you know, you have a little bit of technical background. Your parents have some sort of technical job or had some sort of technical skill. And that gave me the option that I could go into the design side. Or I could also go into the project management side. And I think that's kind of how the generation has shifted.

Bryan: That's so interesting Uzair you kind of just gave me an aha moment just for myself. I, you know, thinking back to your point, that first-generation Indian-Americans or Pakistani-Americans they have that more technical background. But now as we're approaching, you know, younger generations having that eye for design. There's always the traditional sense that you have to commit to a traditional role. But I like that you're speaking about this, you know, pursuing this other path that you might have not taken.

Uzair: Yeah, I think it's easy to take somebody who's 35-years-old, who's lived in India, or Pakistan, or Asia their whole life and they emigrated to the U.S. And say, "Yeah, we'll put you in a position where you're working in a very technical single function kind of role." I'm not saying that there aren't people who broke out of that role. I mean, there's so many amazing engineers who have flourished when there are so open to that situation, and they just, push their boundaries aside.

But I think it's, you know, not only is there this role, but then you can start... You need to start construction earlier in your life, you can't really jump into it. And so I think, you know, having a technical background allowed me to slip into it and slip into the product management side.

Bryan: Right. Well, speaking of your background, how do you, I think that you've ever had to adapt who you are as a person in the workplace, have you ever seen or experienced that with other people?

Uzair: You know, I've been very fortunate. And, you know, I totally understand that I, you know, being Asian-American being Pakistani-American actually comes with a bit of privilege. And having studied engineering, and being able to say that and let people understand that that's where you're coming from. And that's what your background is, actually gives you a little bit of a boost up. And, you know, people sometimes think I'm smarter than I am. Just based on, you know, what their presumptions about me and my background are, you know.

So I think that that's not really hurt me too much. I am very fortunate I've never experienced discrimination in the workplace, with my clients, with my contractors with architects. I think that's also part of the factor of doing the majority of my work in Southern California, where it's a very accepting geographical location.

Bryan: You're right, I think we do live in a part of the nation that is exceptionally diverse, in terms of the cultures here. And that allows us to flourish I mean, I think it's allowed me to flourish. I think well, I've, worked in, I would...this is what I would say that we work in a predominantly white male industry. But the fact that we live in Southern California, that it's so I would say it's liberal. A lot of diverse cultures that is allowed me to flourish and it's nice to hear that it's also allowed you to flourish.

Uzair: I think that's, you know, part of the thing, which was so fun, especially in the year that, you know, I graduated in 2009, our class was extremely diverse. There were quite a few women, especially amongst the sub engineering, tracks. And civil engineering, I feel like civil and environmental engineering had a lot of women compared to the others. And there's a pretty wide ethnic diversity. We had good diversity from the get-go. And I think that what's awesome is that the companies that came to our career fairs were agnostic and very impartial to the people that they were hired. They just wanted to grab some of the best talents regardless of who it was.

And I think that was fun that, you know, we had my intern class at that general contractor had, I think, two or three women. And actually, I think our intern group, who was headed by a project engineer, or a senior project engineer, from that company, who kind of like, you know, oversaw. And like, you know, took us out for the cultural side of the company and really recruited us to stay at the company. She was a woman who is, you know, probably graduated like a couple of years before us.

Bryan: To your point, I think that I've been blessed that I haven't really also experienced discrimination. You know, with MATT Construction, the previous company that I worked with, they embraced, my background, they embraced my perspective. And I think that's what at USC, we've been blessed that companies are there looking for the best talent. And that's quite... It's just about talent.

Uzair: Yeah. And I think it's just really fortunate of, you know, living in this part of the country.

Bryan: Yeah, I mean, I think it's. I hope that people who are listening have that, the same experiences in their part of the country. But I do know that in some parts of this, the United States, it's not a reality for all. So I wanna segue into why diversity, equity, and inclusion is important in the workplace. Do you think it adds value?

Uzair: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I think that you have to understand everybody's perspective. And especially when we're building spaces, right, everybody looks at a place differently, everybody experiences everything differently. And, frankly, we are building facilities and offices and homes and institutions for, you know, all of the public. So we need to be able to represent and make sure that we are speaking to all people. And I think that's part of the fun part about our jobs. And especially, I've been fortunate to work on lots of facilities, which are at the institutional level, that they attract a diverse user group. And so, therefore, we have to make sure we're including all opinions, all thoughts, into all factors of how we do our work.

Bryan: I mean, I think usually that's a point that I keep coming back to with other guests, you know, this is a tangible environment. We have a tangible job, the built environment is not just for one specific group of individuals or demographic. But, we're building for a public space, especially as we move forward as a society. So I mean, I wanna ask you, how has your perspective been able to inform projects, how has it informed you professionally?

Uzair: Right. I mean, I think directly do I bring a lot to the table as a Pakistani-American as somebody who's raised Muslim? Yeah, there's little bits of elements here and there. We have a corporate client who has a Muslim-based spiritual room in all of their facilities. Or they have a spiritual room, but they make sure to include a specific element geared towards Muslim individuals to perform their prayers. But like, that's pretty much all you can bring, there's not a whole lot of like, things that we need to plan around for the South Asian community for the Muslim community, nothing too crazy.

But I think, what the important thing I bring is that I understand what it is to be different. And I understand that there are other perspectives, right? So you don't...it's not my direct experience, which is influencing, but it's my ability to pause, understand and say, "Well, why don't we check out other perspectives? Why don't we make sure that you know, we're thinking about this specific user group or that specific user group?" And just giving the ability to put a pause and a thought to some of the processes is what I feel like I actually bring rather than anything direct.

Bryan: Do you think that in the architecture industry or the AEC industry here in America, that we should be thinking about other religions? What are your thoughts about the built environment and religion, diversity when it comes to that?

Uzair: I mean, I think it's one of the beauties of LA, right is that there's every single kind of person in Los Angeles, and so we're so fortunate to live in such an environment. And it's just something which I think it's important to think about, even if the implementation doesn't require a whole lot. And it's nice to see that you get thought about and that there's an effort that's been pushed.

Bryan: Great.

Uzair: So it's, I think it's just, you know, that level of okay, you know, maybe there isn't anything specific we need to know. But if there's like a nod or an understanding or something, which you can see through the work, I think that makes people feel like they're heard they're seen.

Bryan: That touches upon questions about where you see the AEC industry in 10 years' time. That idea of, you know, what will spaces look like in 10 years with a more diverse group of people at the helm of projects?

Uzair: Yeah, I know that's a really, really interesting question. Luckily, I'm not an architect, so I don't have to think about how to include it.

Bryan: But we are the owner's representative though, Uzair.

Uzair: I don't actually have to think about it myself and plan for it. I see things becoming more agnostic, actually, and more impartial rather than somebody specific, right. You know, I think that there was a lot of things that you know, for example, people would say, like prayer room, or you know, and that's quickly changed to spiritual room. You're talking about restrooms and how to set that up so everybody is comfortable. Like, you know, there's a client of ours who has a male and female locker room, and, you know, how do we try to do that?

And so I think, bringing in that agnostic added piece to the project. Or basically saying, you know, I'm not saying that we're gonna do away with gendered restrooms or anything like that, but I think that I think it's normalizing things. Normalizing the fact that there's single-stall restrooms throughout a building, or, you know, adjacent to every single one. And, you know, it doesn't need to be labeled as such for a specific purpose. Normalizing that there is a quiet room, and you can go and choose to do whatever you want in that quiet room. Which helps you get in touch with yourself or relax or find your moment. But I think instead of moving to specificity, I think it's moving to inclusion.

Bryan: Absolutely. I was gonna say, I think that it's moving towards more inclusivity. The nomenclature of these spaces, it should open the door for the inclusion of people who don't identify with what, you know, the traditional sense of, I don't know a male or female restroom. As a cisgender gay male, I think about my counterparts here in the LGBTQ community, who may see a male restroom, but not feel comfortable going into something that's labeled as such. I think in 10 years' time, I hope that how we converse now is going to be the way program is set in architectural spaces and whatnot.

Uzair: Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I definitely think like, the more that you talk about it, the more into the quicker it becomes normalized. And I think it's awesome that, you know, some of our clients who have, you know, those amenities, such as a gym, such as a changing room, such as you know. That they are providing, you know, additional spaces for someone who doesn't wanna use the male restroom or the female restroom and is providing the same type of space for anyone to use.

Bryan: Yeah. And I think having, even just making that effort and in the design process is even momentous. It's creating a world of change for everyone.

Uzair: And it is a cost decision, right? Do we want to have single occupancies? Or do we not? And there's like, now they just go in. And it's great to have clients who do that kind of thing.

Bryan: You're absolutely right, that that's a great point Uzair. I wanna segue into clients and the industry as a whole. So as project managers, you know, part of our job is to help advise clients, you know, developing the project teams, and creating more equitable spaces, as we've just discussed. What are some ways that our AEC industry can impact change through our work? I know, we've already touched upon a little bit a few of these topics but...

Uzair: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the biggest things is that you know, when we're fortunate enough to go into an area where we have the ability to hire. You know, we have the ability, and MGAC does a great job of this. They're agnostic on that person's race, gender, you know, how they identify themselves, all of that. And I think that's, you know, pretty amazing as a company. And I think that's what needs to happen more in the AEC community.

For instance, let's take a look at you know, people coming up out of college, right. And so you have your career fairs at, you know, the USC and UCLA, but you know, there's so much talent coming out of the CSU system and the Cal State system. And I know that Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo push out tons of great engineers. But there's just...it's just interesting how much, you know, there's more diversity in the colleges, there's more diversity in the non-private schools. And you see the market, you see people identifying that. And you see the companies identifying that there's talent out there. And they're gonna go and get that talent because it can come in any form.

But I think, you know, the key ways in the AEC community of like, how we can change the work is just making it a normal part of our conversation. Making sure that everybody has heard, making sure that we are making space for those who may sometimes be spoken over to speak. Or to make sure that everybody's getting a chance to provide their input. I think that's one of the best parts about our job, especially because we're often looked to as a kind of like, pulling in all the information from everybody. And just making sure that everybody has an equal voice and really, you know, commanding the table in a fair way and making sure that all voices are being heard.

Bryan: Yeah, I think that at MGAC, at least in our projects, my projects, that's an important task that we take seriously. We wanna ensure that everyone has a voice at the table. We wanna be fair, because you are right we're facilitating information. We are there to ensure that the project is running smoothly, but also that everyone's voices are gonna be heard. What do you think about clients who aren't uncomfortable with diversity? Have you ever run into that?

Uzair: I really haven't. I think I've been super, super fortunate. And I think, you know, luckily, my background it's hospitals. We have a corporate client, who I work closely with. And then its developers I think it's great that people who come to MGAC, people who come to project managers who can actually influence decisions. They're at that point where they don't really care where that help comes from, as long as we help them finish their project on time. Take care of them, take care of their project, it doesn't matter to them, what race you are, how you identify, and so forth, I think. And again, this is coming from me, like I said, a pretty privileged place as a male, Asian-American.

Bryan: What do you say to people who have faced that? Do you think there's ways to the measures that other our co-workers who do face that they can take to make sure that the current client isn't uncomfortable with diversity. Because I know, I've spoken to a few women who sometimes have to face that, that we as men don't.

Uzair: I think it's always showing up as a team. And I always try to work so all of our partners are heard. We've been lucky that you know, some of my team members on specific projects here in Los Angeles, and for some other clients as well have been women. And are, frankly, more talented, more persistent, more aggressive than I am. And so you allow them space, and you back them up, to do it.

So I think the key is, open the door because you know, that they can say it encourages them to say the word so that they start building that confidence. And again, it kind of goes back to seeing a third restroom door, or, you know, whatever. The more that spring is hearing that their voice is allowed to be heard and that it is being heard. And that they have to be you know, to speak, the more they speak, the more they speak with competence.

And so I think, allowing for those opportunities, and I think that goes with, you know, whether it's you know, a person of color, whether it's a person of a different gender. Or it just goes across the board of or even somebody who is, you know, junior, you give them the space to grow. And you have to acknowledge that this is the point for them to talk out. You need to help them be comfortable with having their voice heard.

Bryan: I mean, I think that resonates with me. I mean, I would say that I'm a junior staff member. Well, not totally junior, but that's allowing me to grow. And I think and I'm thankful for the senior project managers and executives that I've worked under that have let me do that. So and also ladies and gentlemen, we are listening from Uzair, who is also very, very persistent. So, do you have any advice for any people who wanna join AEC, but they think they may face discrimination because of the idea that you know, the AEC industry is dominated by white older men?

Uzair: Yeah. I would say be patient and know that the industry is going through a colossal shift. And know that your place is that you know, it's so funny. It's a generational thing, right? And you have to see that this old school mentality of a, you know, white male-dominated construction industry or AEC industry is turning. And so what would I say to somebody who feels that they're of a minority? I'd say come, just come join it, come get in there. Because your voice is heard amongst your, you know, it might not be at the top generation, but I'd say people who are in their 30s, in their 40s now. Even in that's the other thing is that the construction, the AEC industry like it is super adaptable, we've had to adapt all over the place.

And so I wouldn't even say that there's this stigma anymore. That, you know, I think that people are realizing that their junior team members. And people coming up now and people who are in the industry are, you know, not of the same race and gender, of who they used to be. And that's who they have to work with. And I think they adapt. I mean, I think people think that we're a little stiff and, you know, old school. But I really think that construction and engineering and architecture, is full of innovators and people who are adaptable, and you have to shift. You have to shift all the time.

Bryan: I mean, quite frankly, I think it has to do with a lot of, you know, the younger generation millennials, who, you know, aren't as fearful you know, they have no fear. I think you're like you said jump right in and I think and trust yourself, have confidence in yourself. And you're gonna continue pushing boundaries, pushing yourself to the limits. And I mean, both of us can speak from experience, right? Is there I mean, I speak from I thought I was fearful going into construction that. And, you know, I've, unfortunately, had some experiences where, you know, I have faced discrimination, but I've overcome them. And I think that younger generations should stay true to who they are, just remain confident, and don't have that fear. Because that's gonna prevent you from growing.

Uzair: Yeah. And the truth is, you know, when I don't wanna say, pull your weight. But when you show that you're competent, and you show that you are gonna persevere, people acknowledge that they move on, right?

Bryan: If you were starting your own company, Uzair how would you ensure diversity, equity, inclusion, were essential to the company's values?

Uzair: I don't know if I'm ready to start my own company yet. But you know, like somebody is, you know, at first they did it, right? At first, they just made sure it was a diverse environment. And I think, you know, I mean, credit goes to MATT credit goes to the executive staff that they hire, whomever they see fit and who will be a successful leader. And I think it's interesting that the company's helped so many people together, who are all individual leaders, you know. And I think that's, you know, one of the tough things about MGAC is, you know, how do we, you know, align so many people who are strong, passionate, intelligent, but I think this is the key, right?

MGAC just made themselves a diverse company, based on their fundamentals. They said, "We're gonna go hire the best people, whoever they are. We're gonna make sure that they feel comfortable in the environment that we provide for them." And they just did it. And then they take the next step. And they said, "Okay, we're gonna start a diversity inclusion podcast, and we're going to really go forward." And what was heard? "Yes, do it let's." How can we bolster and solidify something that we are already doing? I thought that that was an amazing step.

And I think some people might think it's unnecessary, but again, it's normalizing the conversation. And it may not be required within MGAC. But it may be helpful to normalize the conversation, as, you know, throughout the AEC. And, you know, perhaps, that can influence others, and help to make this normal topic for discussion.

Bryan: Yeah, and I mean, I would say that you know, I do think that MGAC is taking all the proper steps, or the necessary steps to highlight diversity and equity and inclusion, by hiring more diverse groups of people. And they're taking those steps. But I also would like to see, and this is coming from me personally Uzair, at the executive level people who, you know, identify as either with a minority group, for me, it would be an LGBTQ female, male. It could be for a previous guess, it could be a black female, black male because those are what leave lasting impacts, to younger generations. I know for myself, I've never seen an LGBTQ executive in our roles. So that leaves a lasting impression.

Uzair: Now, there are a few on our architecture side that I can immediately go back to actually.

Bryan: And I think that's great. I think that's great that the conversation is stretching into the other sectors. So then this is a tough question. How can you...at least I think so. How can you increase diversity and representation while avoiding tokenization?

Uzair: Well, that is tough. But I think one of the keys is that you have to focus on changing yourself internally. And battling your own internal biases that you may have, whether they're intentional or unintentional. And most of the time, they're unintentional biases. And making sure you're approaching your situation and you know, realizing that you may live in this place of your inherent biases.

You start to acknowledge that you have your intentional, unintentional biases, and you work to combat those and really put yourself in the diagnostic position. I think that goes external. And that's avoiding tokenization, right? You're just looking at everything in as much of an unbiased field as you can. It's not something you can do externally, it's something you have to do internally.

Bryan: That's absolutely true. I struggle with that question because I've thought to myself, how do you avoid tokenization? And I've never really been asked that question, but I was thinking it all it all really for me, at least it was about intention. You just have to the intention behind diversity and representation has to come from a good place. Not just to, like the previous guest has said meeting quotas and whatnot and it's true you shouldn't do. You should not put someone in a position because of a quota or a number because it's not a statistic.

Uzair: Right. And like, you know, let's go to different college graduates, we don't have to go to the USCs and UCLAs, we don't have to even go to the Cal colleges. So let's go to CSUs. So let's go to, you know, sort of community colleges. So let's go wherever we can to see where we can find everybody. And I think that's an external effort which you can make is that you're gonna find some very talented people out there. And I know a lot of discussions around hiring talent. But I think, you know, that's kind of immediately where the mind goes.

Bryan: Absolutely. For your co-workers who have never experienced or haven't had a personal experience and discrimination as a result of their identity. What advice would you give them to be an ally?

Uzair: I think one of the key things is having everybody, you know, examine their own biases that they may have. And I think that was actually extremely successful over the summer during the Black Lives Matter movement. And I thought that it was actually really incredible in, you know, again, this city in our age range where people were reexamining things, as they had seen them their entire life. And I think that you know, when you've encouraged people to question and view from other perspectives, it really allows them to do that self-work, to understand things from somebody else's perspective. But it's, again, it's one of those things where it's, you know, you have to help them focus themselves inward, and really let them do the work on their own. So you have to help them, you have to help guide them to it.

You need to talk and share examples, about things that have happened in your life. Things that you've seen happen to other people, things that they may have done or said which may not have been comfortable for you. If you can bring those examples, then you hopefully can move them to a place where they understand where you're coming from and things that other people might be doing.

Bryan: Yeah, I agree. And I think and right now, the case in point here with this podcast we're helping others view our perspectives. They're listening to our stories. And with that, Uzair I thank you so much. This has been actually...this has been a great conversation with you.

Uzair: Great.

Bryan: Thank you for joining. Thank you for listening to this episode at "MGAC Inner Voices." Check back next month for our next episode.

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqualynn-karsten-774138aa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jacqualynn Karsten</strong></a>, Senior Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong><strong> Hi Jacqualynn, welcome to the Blog! Tell us what you do at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Jacqualynn Karsten (JK): </strong>I am a Senior Project Manager in MGAC’s Seattle office. My role right now is a project manager on the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile Headquarters Renovation</a> in Bellevue, Washington.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how long have you been with MGAC?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>A little over two years.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So that would include one “normal” year, and one year during the pandemic?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Exactly. Pre-COVID and post-COVID feel like different lives, almost. I think that’s true for many people.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely. So, what attracted you to MGAC?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>What drew me to MGAC immediately was their <a href="https://www.mgac.com/fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundamentals</a>. They spoke to me really clearly and I really gravitated toward who MGAC was as an organization.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s awesome—what a wonderful fit. How’s the T-Mobile HQ Renovation coming? </strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I just wrapped up on a plaza renovation. It’s a great element of the project because it’s an area that activates the rest of the campus. It brings people together as a space for all-hands meetings, large gatherings, and celebrations. It was also a bit different from the rest of the projects there I've worked on. It came with a set of challenges—in particular, a set of existing conditions we inherited that included a 27’ wide x 70’ deep hollow core adjacent to the building where a new building portal, concrete, lighting and landscaping was planned. Not to mention the survey was off which then also affected the majority of elevations and all concrete ramping and benching on the east hill. It speaks to the success of the team and the approach that we could overcome so many complicated design elements, taking the project from where it started to where it ended. We recently just handed it over to the client and are excited to see them start using it.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Now that the Plaza Renovation has wrapped, what else is on the front burner? </strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>The other project I'm immersed in is a 10-floor tenant improvement on the T-Mobile campus. The work is broken into four phases between the 10 floors, and each floor is at a different stage of build-out. There’s an element of repetition in the design, so we have been able to anticipate certain problems that may arise as we have worked on the first two floors. It is going extremely well! The team is very cohesive—we’ve worked together on past projects on campus, so it’s turned into a real celebration of all the “lessons learned” to date, and just capitalizing on our cohesion.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Nice! Does that mean you’re in the final stages of the Bellevue Renovation?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>We’re coming into the home stretch! The majority of the heavy renovation build-out work, including the fourth phase of the 10-floor project will be wrapping up at the end of this year. And we anticipate there will be a few assorted items that carry over into early 2022.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What an exciting time! We understand that this project has put a major emphasis on the T-Mobile employee experience?</strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> That’s right. T-Mobile has always put a tremendous amount of focus on their employees and their culture. But until this project, they didn’t bring everything full circle to the physical work environment. It is truly a transformative campus. The bones of the buildings are the same, but everything within the buildings and between has radically changed. It speaks to how serious they are about their employees and their workplace environment going forward.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>It sounds like a great partnership for MGAC!</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Absolutely. When I came on board, the HQ Renovation was already underway. So, there was a partnership already established, and there was true trust. But the heavy lifting, those bigger projects, kicked in after I started. It was really special to be a part of those conversations and hear how they wanted to make this space work for their employees.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> How ideal. It sounds like you’ve also found a great fit in this role! But is it safe to say this wasn’t always your path? What did you want to be when you grew up?
</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I haven't thought about this in a very long time! When I was a kid, I actually wanted to be an archaeologist. And that was because I saw cool TV shows and documentaries where I saw women working and exploring. I loved the idea of finding things that were hidden that you could expose. That really spoke to me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Seeing the visibility of women working in an industry, charting their own path, can be so impactful.</strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> Absolutely. I’ve always liked to take a different path with my personal and professional life. And it didn’t occur to me until many years later that part of what spoke to me about that was seeing a woman do it. These days it resonates a lot more, and I’m trying to do my part to ensure that there’s never just one or two of us in the room.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Tell us more about that! </strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Fortunately, the female population in the industry has grown exponentially since I started 20-plus years ago. I've so enjoyed seeing more and more women actively get into this business, specifically on the construction side—folks that walk in the field and wear boots and a hard hat on a regular basis. I love talking to women in the industry and learning about what motivates them, what got them into the industry, and if there is anything I can do to help keep them here.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s great to hear, and something we are always striving to promote as an organization.</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I really appreciate that about MGAC. It wasn’t something I knew intimately before I joined, but it felt really good when we all came together after I started. Seeing our personnel, it’s very diverse—and it’s our future. We’ll be that much further ahead because of what the organization has been implementing.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What impact do you hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> I hope to make a difference on a couple of levels. I want to have successful projects that our clients enjoy and that our leadership is proud we’re a part of. I also want to be a part of making an impact with our local team, borrowing on my experience with T-Mobile. Our MGAC T-Mobile team feels unique, because we’re there full-time in a campus environment. We have become a very cohesive group, and that’s something I’ve come to appreciate. Being able to work with these people has really made a difference in how I look at the work I do, and I hope I have that effect on them as well.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> Navigating the impacts of COVID has certainly been a challenge. It’s affected every aspect of our lives. In terms of work, our project was deemed essential, so construction was allowed to continue. In fact, our efforts actually increased because our client wanted more work to get done when their people were not on campus. So, a lot of what we’ve been doing over the past year has included becoming more aggressive with the work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What have you learned from the experience?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I’ve always loved teamwork. But the depth of the coordination between project partners that needed to take place to make this work has given me an even deeper appreciation for the power of people coming together. Once you prove that something can be done, it shows the client and the industry what can be the new norm. So, what will be interesting is how we might keep up with that going forward, post-pandemic. That will be our next exploration.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So true! Taking a step back, how do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Well, the “community” for me right now is T-Mobile, because we’re on their campus. But there’s a huge impact to be made there nonetheless—there are some 6,000 employees who will work within their Headquarters. I am so excited for them to come back and see the transformation. I think this project will change the way they work. I think it will improve their efficiency and will reaffirm the company’s culture and the importance of inclusiveness, diversity, and open / flexible work environments.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Right. And even beyond their employees, this project could inspire others.</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> Absolutely. They also have external customers, future partners who come onto their campus. For years to come, this will be a showcase of what they stand for. And that could have a ripple effect in transforming other businesses as well.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What at MGAC has made an impact on you?
</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I would go back to our fundamentals. And I say that because we are not close to our MGAC Headquarters. I’ve found motivation and inspiration going back to those fundamentals and knowing if I’m staying true to those, then I’m doing the right thing by MGAC, and I’m doing the right thing by our clients.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>When it comes to the job, what gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>My favorite part about this industry is that we are always learning, and we can always get better. I like that. I’m not perfect. I’d like to think I’m always doing the right thing, but there are always variables and challenges that teach you important lessons. There’s never a point we hit where we don’t need to learn more.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So, after a day of encountering—and overcoming—obstacles, what’s your secret to winding down?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Trying to turn it off (emphasis on “trying!”). It’s not natural for me to want to shut down and put my phone away or not check email—frankly, it can even be uncomfortable at times! But I find if I intentionally focus on “me time” and spending time with friends and family, I’m better for it the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?
</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I have always been an early riser. For me, the mornings are about getting up and moving. That movement could be exercise; it could be simply walking my dog or getting ready to go to the job site. But it’s about being deliberate, versus being relaxed and of the “I’ll get to it when I get to it” mindset. Getting up with purpose is a great motivator for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What’s a favorite quote that inspires you?
</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>This one isn’t exactly inspirational in the traditional sense, but it’s inspirational to me personally because of who I want to be in the workplace. “Leaders who don’t listen will eventually be surrounded by those who do not speak.” That quote could be scary or intimidating to certain people! But I look at it like, “Who do I want to be for myself, for my clients, and for the people I work with?” It’s an important reminder to listen to everything.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I would say professionally, I would relish the idea of leaving an impact that inspired others to continue in this industry and explore it the way I have been afforded the opportunity to.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>We’ll wrap things up with a few rapid-fire questions—answer with the first response that comes to mind! Sound good?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Sure!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Conduit between client and team. (If I could sneak another word in, it would be “conductor.”)

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Call my superintendent to check-in.<strong>
</strong>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And the last thing?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I try to look at what I have on my calendar for the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Ha! This involves a quick story. My client and I were walking one day. A song came on. I said, “Hey, I like this song!” and it turns out it was by Justin Bieber. I’m not exactly a Justin Bieber fan, but you know, I liked the song. Then the next day, I found a life-sized Justin Bieber cutout at my desk!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Hysterical! So, it was just sitting around? </strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Yeah! T-Mobile has all sorts of that stuff throughout their departments. They knew they had this one and decided to put it at my desk. It was so funny and touching to me so I kept it!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>I’m a big breakfast person, but I often don’t take lunch. My go-to would be whatever is easiest. It could be crackers and fruit, or anything else that is easy to grab and go.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>My Sirius XM app. I love all kinds of music, and I go through moods. I could do a month of classic rock, and then I move on to hip hop, jazz, or blues.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your biggest work goal for 2021?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>Finishing our projects strong and providing a great, appreciative closure to this project for our client.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>JK: </strong>That I love to entertain. It’s a way that I show friends and family how I care about them. I think most of my coworkers don’t know that, because prior to COVID-19, we were still getting to know each other. And then the pandemic hit!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So, you’re due for a dinner party! </strong>

<strong>JK:</strong> You could say that!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Wednesday, the <strong>July 2021 Top Workplaces National Awards</strong> were revealed. This is the first year that Top Workplaces has offered year-round national employer recognition. MGAC is honored to have won a Culture Excellence Award in the categories of Compensation, Employee Value Proposition, Work Life Flexibility, and Top Managers.

MGAC’s <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/stephanie-cramer-/93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie Cramer</a>, Vice President of Talent, reflects on what this win means for the company. “MGAC is humbled to win not only <em>The Washington Post</em>'s 2021 Top Workplaces Award in the Washington, DC area, but also the 2021 National Culture Excellence Awards. It’s a true embodiment of our employees, workspaces, and projects. These awards are always a celebrated accomplishment. But, to win these awards for 2021 takes on special new meaning. 2020-2021, ‘the pandemic years’ have tried and stretched us in ways never before imagined. Our teams stepped up and redefined what it means to collaborate and work together. I couldn’t be more proud of our team and am forever grateful for an ever evolving culture that gets better year after year.”

This builds on our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-recognized-as-top-workplace-in-the-washington-posts-annual-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Top Workplaces</a> win in the greater Washington, DC area. To celebrate these wins, MGAC employees gathered for cocktails and hors d’oeuvres in each of our office locations. Thank you to our staff for their commitment to maintaining a strong and inclusive culture. We couldn’t do what we do without you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/technology-solutions">Technology Solutions</a> projects.</em>
<h4><strong>Bureaucratic Beginnings</strong></h4>
MGAC’s inaugural technology team took on the first official Technology Solutions project in 2011. We had the opportunity to provide technology solutions services for the new <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/defense-advanced-research-projects-agency-darpa-/209">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA) headquarters in Arlington, VA. MGAC was first engaged as a project management partner for the 13-story, 350,000 SF headquarters. The technology team was brought in to provide oversight on all technology infrastructure installations, system deployments, integrations, and commissioning. Our contributions resulted in the successful deployment of structured cabling, multiple networks, voice platforms, audio-visual, video conferencing, access control, CCTV, CATV, active IT equipment, land mobile radio, and cellular reinforcement systems. The structure incorporated the latest security measures and featured redundancy in services and power across the data center and various building support systems. Our technology team also helped to procure several special services contracts for this project that included the electronic security and video surveillance system, as well as the audio-visual components. Once completed, 1,200 DARPA employees seamlessly transitioned from their previous home to the newly completed headquarters.

With that experience under our belt, we were able to begin working for the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-/189">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) to meet the growing and increasingly complex technology needs associated with multiple headquarter, regional critical data center, and field office projects. By this time, MGAC had solidified a reputation for taking on some of the most challenging builds around the country by partnering with our clients to solve unique technology challenges. These early technology projects certainly met this standard. Success meant our team was able to take on even more complex and technical projects. As our team continued to grow, so did our capabilities. With technology evolving at warp speed, that expertise was quickly put to work as the Technology Solutions team expanded its service offerings to meet the unique needs of our clients.
<h4><strong>A Decade of Evolution</strong></h4>
Since these first projects with DARPA and the FBI, the MGAC technology team has been consistently evolving to stay on par with the near-daily changes to the application and integration of technology in the built environment. As a result, the projects that our team is working on, and the services that we offer, are much more complex than the projects we completed in the early days of the Technology Solutions team. Specifically, the quantity and type of platforms we work with today and how they integrate are far more advanced. Buildings have gotten smarter. There are more data points available in today’s building systems than ever before, and this data helps operators manage their buildings more efficiently. To guide our clients through the implementation of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/technology-solutions">Technology Solutions</a>, we have structured our service offering around MGAC’s core <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/what-is-an-owners-rep/">Owner’s Representation</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/program-management">Program Management</a> philosophy. This has allowed us to hone our services to meet the specific needs of our clients. Today’s Technology Solutions services include strategic advising, pre-design, technology design, implementation, management, and optimization.

For most projects, our first engagement focuses on our strategic advisory and pre-design services. We partner with our clients to understand their high-level goals and objectives and frame up the solution to their multiple challenges. This is where we work to get in front of projects and sit down with our client teams, whether they are in IT, facilities, or design and construction, to discuss project needs and requirements. If needed, we support our clients through IT and asset strategy development, program development, growth and cost modeling, site selection, and the evaluation of existing facilities to gain an understanding of how they might play a part in the long-term strategy. By doing this, we help ensure that technology integration is front and center through the design process.

Once a project is underway, the team can become an integrated design partner to provide technology design and/or design oversight for all project types. With qualified and certified technology designers on staff, the Technology Solutions team at MGAC can design, stamp, and seal technology construction documents. Our design work spans the various technology systems found in new buildings and can include structured cabling, Wi-Fi networks, integrated building technology, security, audio-visual, and various other platforms.

Hand-in-hand with technology design is our implementation service. Our team oversees the integration of technology, leads IT consulting, manages migration implementation and the planning and/or move process for data centers, and conducts the commissioning of technology systems. Additionally, we have found that by helping our clients with the procurement of IT, DAS, audio-visual, and security systems, we can streamline the process, remove the possibility of miscommunication, and drive greater efficiencies in delivering these systems.

The technology management service parallels MGAC’s project management services. Our technology solutions team leverages our proven program / project delivery methodology to ensure that technology solutions are cost-effective, scalable, flexible, and delivered on time. We provide our clients with one central point-of-control and accountability. Finally, our optimization services look to review opportunities to deliver efficiencies, cut costs, reduce footprints, optimize environments, improve uptime, and/or provide studies to help our clients accomplish their goals for existing spaces.

Individually or combined, our services meet and exceed our client’s demands. Every project brings exciting, unique challenges and requirements that the previous project did not have. Our team consistently evolves to meet these assignments to ensure we are prepared for the next project and the one after that.
<h4><strong>Diversified Clients, Distinct Projects</strong></h4>
Our team has successfully delivered projects across each of MGAC’s market sectors. In the education space, we are currently helping <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/21st-century-schools-baltimore-city-public-schools/218">Baltimore City Public Schools</a> and a world-renowned Ivy League university on major technology system upgrades. In the healthcare sector, we are completing a new project with White Plains Hospital. This project is the most substantial campus modernization and expansion campaign in its 127-year history and will ensure a next-generation patient experience. In the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/luxury-living/">luxury living</a> realm, our team has worked with some of the world’s most high-profile families to ensure discreet security and connectivity in private spaces. On the corporate side of things, we have worked with <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-greetings-headquarters/190">American Greetings</a> on the relocation of an 1,800-employee headquarters, on <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-geophysical-union-agu-headquarters/20">American Geophysical Union’s</a> innovative net-zero energy renovation project, and with World Bank on multiple data center builds and migration projects. On the cultural front, our team helped deliver <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/glenstone-the-pavilions/194">The Pavilions</a>, Glenstone Museum’s largest campus expansion, including indoor and outdoor exhibition and visitor experience spaces for a truly one-of-a-kind visitor experience, while seamlessly and covertly integrating technology into every aspect of the project.

The diversity of projects, each with unique challenges and goals, ensures a widely skilled, nimble team that looks forward to the job each day. We know we can bring every building type—from dated buildings and data centers to ground-up construction projects—into the future because we have made that happen in innovative and groundbreaking ways. Our experience and expertise, which spans everything from cabling to commissioning, and our ability to understand and meet the needs of both client IT teams and contractors puts us in a unique position to take on the built environment’s most innovative, complex, and wide-ranging projects. That is the space in which we love to operate—and where we will continue to thrive for years to come.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Beth: Hi, welcome to "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast where we endeavor to dig into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. I'm Beth Scully, I'm based in Seattle, Washington. I'm a senior project manager. We want to say, we're not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. You're listening to two people having a conversation about our lived experiences in the hopes that as we share our thoughts and stories, they will offer hope and help as a catalyst for further thought on a subject. We hope that exploring issues of DEI, we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. Today, we'll be chatting with Jason Bell, a senior project manager in Washington, D.C. So welcome in, Jason, to our podcast.

Jason: Thank you very much.

Beth: Can you tell us a little bit about yourself for our listeners?

Jason: Sure. Thank you very much for the kind introduction. My name is Jason Bell. I live here in Washington, D.C. I've been in the construction industry for 18 years, longtime career construction development guy and I absolutely love it. Have a wife and two children and lived kind of across the country. Been in D.C. for several years, but also lived down in Atlanta, Georgia, Virginia Beach, California in the Bay Area growing up until I was about 13,14. Then again, for five years when my wife and I got married and had our children before deciding to move back to the East Coast. So been all around and definitely a lifer in the construction industry, I believe. So, excited to be here.

Beth: This is gonna be fun, friend. You ready to get right to it?

Jason: Absolutely. Let's dive in.

Beth: So let's just start, how has your identity as an African American male affected you in your professional spaces? Have you experienced discrimination from potential employers? Let's start there.

Jason: Sure. It's hard to say on the potential employer's part, you know, you apply to jobs and sometimes you just don't get them. And I like to believe that in those cases, I just wasn't the right fit or didn't have the particular experience that they were looking for. So not knowingly have I ever experienced any kind of discrimination and, you know, from a potential job point of view. My experience has been more probably, and I want to put this in the right context, I just say prejudice or assumptions about who I was or my background, perhaps, that I had to overcome more than, you know, outright, blatant discrimination. But I think that that aligns to your first kind of question, how do I perceive those stereotypes about African American males and African Americans in general and how I have tried to, in my own way, combat them or head those often negative stereotypes, cut them off before they have a chance to take root in any kind of perception about how I operate or my capabilities. These things, they do have a real effect on how people act and interact, so I think that it's important that we have these kinds of conversations to really give people who maybe don't have that experience, a look into how people act and try to learn so that we don't repeat similar mistakes going forward. This is an honest attempt to learn and have these conversations. So that's really why I'm here and decided to take this opportunity to have this conversation.

Beth: You know, immediately, I already want to explore something. You've identified that you can see a path towards a stereotype and heading those off at the past. Can you talk a little bit about that, what you've experienced in that arena?

Jason: Sure. So I think that one of the common conceptions about African Americans, and African American males probably in particular, is that we're, you know, maybe overly aggressive or intimidating in any kind of way. Or perhaps there's affirmative action higher or something like that, that people try to put down your accomplishments or change who you are as a person solely based on the way you look. There are a lot of unique things about people that aren't on full display when you first meet them. Having different colored skin is not something that you can hide, those things are relevant and in your face, quite literally and figuratively, when you first meet people so, you know, to kind of speak to that angry or aggressive stereotype, right? You know, I tried to, and I think this is kind of how I am, but I am especially conscious of it anyway. You know, I'm not a yeller or a screamer or a bully in any shape or fashion. That's not how I choose to operate, that's not how I am. That can be good and bad, there's a lot of testosterone in real estate and construction industry. So that level of intensity often has to be matched when you're having a discussion or disagreeing with somebody, which inevitably will happen. I am very conscious of taking my time, keeping my cool, letting the facts kind of dictate how I engage. When it comes time to correct somebody, you know, I try to do it in a voice much like I'm talking to you right now. I just speak to them, you know, directly, look them in the eye and all those kinds of things. I'm a professional, I present that way because that's who I am. So I kind of take that known stereotype and I instantly try to extinguish it. So I am extremely conscious of how I am perceived and how I come off. And speaking about that kind of affirmative action role or implication, right, I don't want that to be on the table at all in terms of people having that perception that that's a way for less qualified people to advance and take advantage of a system and that's not who I am at all. I want to show that I am operating at a high level at all times and that my work, and my product that I produce, and the relationships are unquestionably good, that's the kind of image that I work hard to maintain and present outwardly. So, you know, there are some steps that I consciously take to make sure that those things are just taken off the table.

Beth: I wonder, have you ever faced discrimination from employers or supervisors? Was it there but not known? What has been your experience in that area?

Jason: Sure, sure. So where these things sometimes show themselves are less in, out and out, you know, just kind of disrespect or saying, "Oh, well, you can't do that because of who you are," anything like that. I talked about the perception or the way that I address things. I've seen white men, white women, other races where that kind of style, because it tends to be ingrained in a lot of places within the industry, those people who are yellers and screamers are jerks, for lack of a better term, advanced and get placed and move up. And their work product isn't any better than mine, but I think that those people who are in management faces and leaders kind of can't always recognize my style and juxtapose that with the fact that I look different. So that's already two differences. And so they can't see themselves often in somebody who doesn't look like them so they can't recognize when they are doing the right things. And I think that sometimes that that is a perception that I've had to deal with. I talk about, you know, my calm demeanor, and how I address things, and all that kind of stuff, that sometimes can be seen as a negative, like, "Jason's not engaged." Right? Because I'm listening and not talking. I'm not trying to get my point, you know, I'm not trying to make myself the center of the attention or have my viewpoint be the end-all-be-all, right? I'm more reserved than that, I had somebody once describe me as being cerebral, which I guess is a compliment. But that perception can be turned around against you because, "Oh, well, he's not a leader because he's not jumping up and down and screaming," right, "he doesn't have the tools to do some of these things." And I think that those kinds of perceptions have sometimes maybe held me back from being recognized for...not saying I'm perfect or having some flaws, but now being said, "Okay, well, he's not up to level because he's not doing these things the way that I have done them or the way that I can't see how I can relate to him and help him do these things." It's always, it's like a weird imbalance or difference in the way that I get sometimes treated.

So I can't particularly talk to one situation where I felt like I was directly threatened, but there have been times where I feel that co-workers, supervisors, you know, other outside consultants, for whatever reason, feel like they can't relate or maybe they overthink it in the other direction, like, "Okay, well, this is somebody who's different or whatever." And, really, it's those kinds of things are completely unnecessary. We're all professionals in this industry. One of the good things about this industry, in general, is your worth is very much in the equity of your work. How long have you been doing what you've been doing? How many projects have you done like this? The people who, in general, who move up, are there because they've done the work, they know what they're doing and they know how to do it. So those types of perceptions, more or less, they start to go away a little bit as you continue to move up and I think for that reason, those kind of instances seem to come fewer and farther apart as I become more senior, but they don't go away completely. And you'll find times where people are unnecessarily awkward, extremely awkward with you, with me, where there's really no need to be in that position. It's more of a inability sometimes to relate, maybe that's the best way to say it. It's just as easy as talking to me like I'm talking to you right now.

Beth: Mind-boggling isn't it, friend? We're just humans, we're doing great work together. And yet, you've spoken of an awkwardness that is still there, which is why we're having this very conversation to say, "Why is that awkward?" And what can we do to overcome, and challenge, and get underneath it and really have these conversations? So I'm wondering, have you experienced those kind of moments with clients? How have you handled that? And how can your colleagues be allies to you when it surfaces?

Jason: Sure, if a client had an issue with me or was discriminatory against me, I think I've been fortunate, I'd say, that my work has been able to speak for itself in terms of the quality of the work, my ability to have good conversations with people and relate to them so as to put those things at ease. My demeanor has been able to put those kind of things at ease, you kind of already mentioned it, you know, your co-workers tend to be your best allies, in that they spend a lot more time with you to work on a myriad of different projects and go out to lunch with you or you have team bonding and you go out to have drinks or whatever, they know you personally on a level that others don't. So they can speak to your ability, speak to the type of person that you are, and really defend you and advocate for you when you're not in the room. In a lot of places, you don't see folks that look like me, folks that look like, you know, some other traditionally or historically marginalized groups, you don't often see those folks in upper-levels of leadership and management. And everybody knows there are conversations that happen behind closed doors at the C-suite level, etc, etc. Who is going to get promoted, who's going to move on this job, that job, this, and the other. You'd like to think that you have people in that room who know your role, know the work that needs to be done, also know who you are and the type of person that you are. You want to be on that list, you want to be recognized for the work that you do, you want to be given opportunity to do more work and expanding work. And when it comes to a time because it happens all the time, where somebody needs to go out or maybe they need to take a bigger step, a promotion or what have you, a more difficult project maybe they've handled before, you need somebody who's in there and can advocate and say that, "Jason can do it." And not even from a sense of, "We need to have Jason do it because he's as a black man or whatever." But to say, "Jason has the skills to do the work. And yes, it may be a "risk" but I know the type of work and the type of person that he is, I know he can address it and handle it." And those are the kinds of people that you want on your team that take the kind of color out of it and see you as the person that you are, which is everybody's goal, I believe. You know, I think that the color part comes into it more on a social interaction kind of level. And that's a little bit different than if you just focus on the ability to do the work, that's a completely different conversation.

Beth: Yeah, I mean, we all just really at the end of the day, we want to be judged on the merits of our work, right?

Jason: Absolutely.

Beth: Yeah. Let's talk about a couple of keywords that you'd like to chat about. And I'll begin with the race card. What are your thoughts around this?

Jason: I don't like it, at all. And I don't like it because it's become, like, if you think about playing cards, it's like a joker or something, you know, some kind of wild card that just you have and you can play it and all of a sudden you win some kind of... I just really just despise the term. And again, I think, and I said this to you, the perception is that that is, like, the cards you play when you don't have anything else to use or the first place you go when you feel like you've been maybe passed over for something that you felt like you deserved. And it's really, in my experience, the last place that anybody goes because, like you talked about wanting to be recognized for the merits of your work, right? Everybody has their, hopefully, a positive opinion of themselves and what they can do. When you get disappointed, or you're turned down for whatever, or you're having a hard time talking or connecting with somebody, you do go through all this kind of checklist like, "Well, did I present this point well? Was I prepared?" You go through all these things to make sure that your work, first and foremost, was right, or that you presented yourself in a professional manner, or that you didn't do anything else to cause discomfort, or disconnect, or outright rift between you and whoever. And then when you've exhausted all of that, and in your own mind, at least, you've kind of thought through what you produced, and everything seems, like, unquestionably good, you start thinking, "Well, what else could it be?" Sometimes you just don't feel like it's fair, it's not a good feeling to think that despite your best efforts that something that you have absolutely no control over is going to hit you right between the eyes. And that is a very tough pill to swallow. And that's why I think it does stay kind of as the last thing that you want to pull out. Because it's like, man, it's so unfair and it's so out of your control that it makes you angry to even have to think to go there.

Beth: Yeah. And, you know, you're so thoughtful and so deep and you're always examining, did you put your best work forward? But, you know, again, there is history in this country. And there is the existence of unconscious bias. And whether we want to outright say the race card or whatever, the presence of unconscious bias, which is, again, why we're having this conversation, hopefully, folks who haven't checked themselves on the regular to say, "Do I have unconscious biases? And how do I explore that?" And the discomfort of holding that space and going deep there so that we grow as humans and we start to really chip away at removing this. That it's just a matter of being judged on the content of your work, right? Again.

Jason: Absolutely.

Beth: So we have another word, friend, the burden. Shall we chat about the burden? What is the burden? And what are your thoughts on the burden?

Jason: The burden, in the way I'm using it, is kind of acknowledging the cultural differences and the history of the country and knowing the way that past experiences have influenced the present and continue to influence the present. We have an opportunity that as we work with these things in the present, that we have a different type of future, that kind of burden seems to fall mainly on marginalized people, people of color to essentially prove that these things do exist. Juneteenth becomes a national holiday. I've known about Juneteenth since I was 9, 10. And I didn't learn it in school, I learned it from my parents and my friends of my family. African Americans had been celebrating Juneteenth for a very long time and what history has taught, what history has known. This stuff, it continues to happen and show its head. So when you talk about knowing those things and putting those kinds of things in context, why should I be the only one who kind of knows that and acknowledges that and let that influence how I am working in the world? That was a known event, and yet, if you polled a lot of people, and I'm including African Americans, people of color, etc., it's not something that's taught in school, it has to be taught outside of the classroom, or you have to go seek, gain that knowledge yourself. If every high schooler had that kind of context, you know, before they went out of their little bubble in high school and went to college where you're definitely going to be exposed to new people and new ideas, and they go out into the world where you're no longer, maybe those things wouldn't be passed as often if they had some context and some history and some knowledge of those things. And it's difficult to have those kinds of difficult conversations and make changes that will lead to kind of improved relations unless the majority acknowledges that there's a problem and is willing to do the work to fix it.

If you look on social media, a lot of people, a lot of African Americans are like, "Okay, that's good, but that's not what we asked for. It wasn't a part of any kind of agenda." It's nice to have acknowledgment, but it doesn't really move the needle. Without the history, without the knowledge, without the context, it's just a day. And people too often take, you know, it's just a day off. It could be another reason to have a sale, you know, comes up for some commercial holiday and now it doesn't mean anything. It's almost like, I want to be acknowledged, but I'd rather just have the day to reflect...the country should reflect on what this really means, 1776 to 1867. What's freedom? And I think that's a difficult conversation and that probably affects a lot of people's perception of how they view, you know, the country, or maybe not. But it's relevant in the way that a lot of people feel. They have all these high aspirations and statements about what the country is and when it doesn't live up to that, it causes, and this is anybody, causes anybody to question or get angry about what that reality means. People will have a reaction like, "Well, now I've got to celebrate Juneteenth? Does that mean that I can't celebrate the 4th of July?" No, it's just something else to put in your head. That's something that happened, it really happened. And it shows a symptom of something that has happened in the country and continues to happen. You know, what about things that really make a difference? Like I said, education, why aren't we teaching this in the school? Why is it such a surprise?

Beth: Why do people have to google this? And I would suggest that there's a whole history that has never been acknowledged that is not taught today in schools of the African American experience in this country. And it's not taught as part of history, it is not yet in the books. Some of the horrible atrocities that have happened that led to, and I'm with you, friend, it's like there's a whole lot of history that is not being taught, people don't know it. And we have so much work to do yet to get it into the books.

Jason: Yeah, you talk about representation. You know, there's a rightful reverence and interest in, like, World War II, fighting the good fight against something that's unquestionably evil. World War II also, it's like in the strategy and all that happens, and all the stories, it's amazing. But then you go back and you look at pictures of the people who were fighting the war. And if you look at all the famous pictures, all white males. But there were definitely African Americans serving, some of them in my family. But they were relegated to positions of, either, for the most part, quartermasters, cooks, you know, deck-hands if you're on a boat. Those African American men existed, they fought, and then they came home and they were still second-class citizens. So not only do you get the disrespect kind of in your face when you come home, but now you're not even talked about in the history books. Now you're not in all those epic war movies. Now you're not represented for life, for eternity as having participated in a World War as part of the United States. How does that lack of recognition change your perception of the war and of the promise of the United States?

Beth: Well, I mean, let's be clear, that is a truth for every war that this country is engaged in. It is not like African American males were not contributing and, in fact, leading some of those efforts, and yet they're not represented. Let's talk about the comfort in sharing these kinds of things and recommending solutions.

Jason: I'm glad that this forum exists. I'm glad that this is something that people want and have an interest in learning about this knowledge. This is something that's going to be used in a genuine manner. Is there genuine interest in it? Is this something that, you know, people are going to say, "Oh, wow, that's great. Thanks for your story," then move on and don't do anything with it? Is it something that people are just doing for the fight, for the look of it? Is this something that is really going to be taken seriously and something's going to be done with it? Or is your experience going to be just used for people to feel good about...? There's a level of trust that comes with being honest and open.

Beth: So how do we calibrate and measure our progress? Or if we're treating it like that, how do we ensure that this doesn't just become another blip where we acknowledged, we said, "Yeah, okay, tick. We acknowledged, we spoke about it, game over." Because we certainly know, we're nowhere close to game over on this topic, or, you know, there are so many things for us yet to tackle. And so, I'm curious your thoughts about how do we measure and how do we ensure that we're kicking it forward?

Jason: I'm gonna punt on the how do we measure and I would focus on how do we maintain it? The more you talk about something, the more you learn, the deeper the questions get, the more interest is gained, etc., etc. Now you start seeing all these different things and you start going in different directions. If you don't have a kind of a company or a workgroup, whatever, goal, and a plan, and a method to bring these things in and bring these issues to the consciousness of the workplace, it's going to be a blip on somebody's radar. There's more of a desire to having these kinds of conversations, it's got to start somewhere. Lots of companies started to hire chief diversity officers, that's a permanent position that is essentially helping craft the culture of the office of the workplace such that the company is successful, let's not be naive in thinking that companies don't want to do the best they can and will take whatever opportunity they can to, you know, get the best talent, be the best version of themselves. It doesn't have to be hitting, you know, banging somebody over the head with it. Just a consistent plan to recognize and for people to check their preconceived notions as it relates to the work because we spend so much time at work, especially Americans, it's one of the best places to reach people. Need to maintain consistency, need to maintain and have a plan to make it just a part of business at your company. To make sure that people see different perspectives, people of all shades and all backgrounds represented at all levels of the company, and make sure that the merit in terms of work is what is driving people up, down, left, right within the organization to help remove the boys club or the girls club and whatever kind of silo that you're in within the organization. I think it's really about creating access and maintaining access to have the conversations to bring education to your company, maybe a little bit of metrics to kind of look at maybe your workforce and say, like, "How closely does my workforce resemble the United States? How does my C-suite look?" When I was applying for this job, when I was looking for this job and I was going on any potential company's website, I'd look at what the composition of the company was in the C-suite and the leaders. There was a job that I would apply to, looked great on paper. I went to the page and they had a lot more than just the C-suite. And I didn't see one person of color, period. At all.

Beth: Not one.

Jason: And they had a lot of people listed on the website. And it was, like, wow, how does this happen? Because I know, I know that there are people of color everywhere. And I know there are people of color and minority groups and in every walk of life, in every profession. And I got a call back to, like, apply. And by the time they got to me, I was like, "No, thank you." To be in a position where you are clearly different is so intimidating and I think that that is something, again, that people in the majority don't have to often think about. Almost everywhere I've worked, many places I've worked, I've been the only African American that's in a position of leadership and management on the job. It's a feeling that takes getting used to, to feel like people have all these eyes on you and feel like they're first judging you and perceiving you even if they aren't, you start to notice your own differences. Now, you're either acting unlike yourself to try and fit in, or you are unwilling to show people maybe who you are for fear of becoming even more different and being more on the outside. It's an odd feeling, there's a level of confidence. And like I said, some of those steps that you take to make sure that you are accepted for who you are without necessarily compromising who you are or hurting your opportunities to advance, because that's what everybody wants to do. Everybody wants to continue to advance, okay.

Beth: It's an impact on your personal safety, right? All of those things impact your feeling of personal safety within an organization. And to that end, you know, I'm wondering, let's explore what the greater big picture impact of this kind of treatment behavior and discrimination beyond a specific event itself, what is the greater big picture impact in your mind?

Jason: In my particular experience, you know, being perceived as not engaged or not able to have the ability to lead or to take action, being hesitant or whatever, when what I'm doing is thinking through a topic or making sure that I have my stuff in order, the way that I act. Does that somehow signal something to the rest of the company that people like me are going to do the same thing, or maybe aren't in a position to lead? Does that happen? I took myself out of the pool for a potential opportunity, because I didn't see somebody that looked like me on the website. That's twofold, right? That company's search continues and my search continues. Now we're not making a connection based solely on something that I saw, not a perception, that was real. I'd have to make that up. So now you have, potentially, people taking themselves out of places where maybe they thought they could be happier, places where they thought they could contribute, you've taken yourself out of the pool. So in an industry like real estate, construction, all those industries that are traditionally been white men, people have self-segregated themselves so that that industry continues to look like that. What's gonna stop some client or some job that you're chasing, you know, somebody's doing the same thing that I did and say, "Hey, let's take a look at who these people are. Oh, wow, they're very homogenous." Those people who do good work that are outside of the "norm" are out there, they exist. And I think it's in your best interest as a company to have those people on your team, you want that diversity of experience, the diversity of thought, that kind of initial perception can be huge, that can have other ripple effects outside of the industry.

Beth: I'm going to ask you a very specific and personal question, if we can do that. How does your unique identity make you a strong asset to your team and how has it informed who you are professionally?

Jason: I'm an introvert, kind of by nature. But I'm an only child, so I tend to listen and I am perfectly happy kind of being in my own thoughts and I don't need outside influences to necessarily get me going, it comes from inside. Kind of that ability to listen, especially in a client-serving business has always served me well. Say, you know, in a situation where you have a conflict that you need to get resolved, somebody is trying to sell you on what they did and why they did our change order. If you bite your tongue and let them talk, either they're going to prove their point, or they will prove your point for you. That's a tactic, take that flipside. If you're listening to your client and the client has this laundry list of things, they think they want part of our job as managers, and especially managers for owners is to help them realize their vision. And sometimes, people don't know what they want, your job is to come in and say, "Okay, you have these five things that you say you want, but do you really want those five things?" If you're not paying attention, you may take that first thing that they say and just go down that path. But if you take time and listen and let them explain it to you, now you can help them prioritize. When you have that, now your job as a project manager or construction manager, what have you, becomes a heck of a lot easier, because they told you exactly what they want you to deliver and you can help them get there. That makes me a strong asset, I listen. For the most part, my personality hasn't been a detriment in any way now that I've kind of become self-aware, and recognize those things about myself, and how I handle things, and how my personality is a benefit, and where I need to make sure that it doesn't become a hindrance.

Beth: I've got a three-pronged question for you. And I'd like to hear your thoughts on ways that we can impact change in the future, in the AEC industry, at a company level within MGAC, and with our colleagues at MGAC. Do you want to chat first about the AEC industry?

Jason: Somebody has a line out there somewhere, representation matters, you know, a little tagline that makes it easy to remember. But it's true, who are kind of the flag bearers for the industry. There are AEC firms that are led by women, that are led by African Americans, those companies exist and are successful. But do you know about them? How much have you been exposed to them? One of the things that's important is giving those people who have traditionally been marginalized those opportunities, people get risks taken on them all the time to see whether they can perform, and sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. That opportunity to go do new things is something that I think that all industries, but the AEC industry can embrace because there are skilled people within the industry that will continue to stay in the industry if given the opportunity to succeed at a company level, make connections within the community. Show people that these types of jobs exist, you never know what's going to spark somebody's passion. There's a world-renowned HBCU 96 miles from where I'm sitting right now. Go get them. Go get the people that you say you want, they're easy to find, we're all easy to find. Follow through, it's not hard to get somebody in your door. And again, maybe that person that you hire doesn't stay, you never know. But if you don't have those people on your team, then you're not going to have that ability to impact people outside of that sphere.

Beth: It's real.

Jason: It's huge. Go out and get them.

Beth: So what about with colleagues? Let's get down to the granularity.

Jason: There's a level of discomfort that kind of these conversations carry with them, it's important to have those conversations. I think one-on-one is best because it takes some of that discomfort out of it, and have that conversation, which is uncomfortable, but at least you have a level of trust with that person, you know, for both sides. The person that you're asking, a person of color, or a person of different background, they're going to give you an honest answer. And that the person or the person of color, that the person receiving the information is going to actually take it to heart and actually think about it. Actually, acknowledge it. If either of the side isn't honest and isn't prepared to have an uncomfortable conversation, it's not going to be worthwhile. It shouldn't be a spur of the moment thing, there should be some thought behind it. I won't say there's a fine line, but there's a line between ignorance and asking a question that you really don't know the answer to. And it comes out in the way that you craft your question. You know, if you can show the person that has information that you want, that you take what they do seriously, or that you value their opinion. And you also have taken enough interest in what they are doing and the information that you want to gain to have done some work on your own account, wow, they'll tell you the world if you show them that you've tried to understand where they're coming from and show an actual interest and value their opinion in something. Take the time, come up with a series of questions, really drill down on what you want to understand or what you want to know, this is establishing trust, establishing credibility.

Beth: Yeah, I'm thinking about something you said, Jason, because I think it's important to call it out, and address it, and help folks because there are ignorant questions, right? And so my mind went to the place of, I don't think as humans we want to ask ignorant questions, I don't think we want to walk in the world as ignorant people, but where I'm going back to is, perhaps, being thoughtful about not just the what you want to know, but the why you want to know it. And we've touched on this as we've chatted today, there's a whole history that has not been written. Get after that, get after that history, start doing some searching, start doing some digging into what aspects of the African American community are not yet written, are not yet taught. And then, like, let that maybe be a starting point for folks that are really interested in starting a conversation not based on ignorance, but really wanting to relate, and understand, and know the what and the why. Because I think the why is so important, right?

Jason: Yeah, absolutely. People need to be given credit for asking the question. It takes some humility to ask a question that has, you know, thorns on it, that's prickly.

Beth: It's not a light topic. It's not a light topic. This is not just some, "Oh, hey, bud, I was thinking about this the other night," and, you know, like, these are sacred grounds that we're walking on, right? And they need the respect and the honor they are due in order to engage and in order to grow as humans and
just have these conversations. There's still voter suppression, there's still a myriad of things that we've got to overcome. Not the least of which is the young African American men that still cannot walk freely on the streets and not feel safe.

Jason: Yeah, I mean, those kind of things happened to me, you know, personally. I was coming home from college, driving to my parent's house in my dad's car. Plates were in order, registration and all that kind of stuff, no broken taillight, nothing. Coming down route one and a police officer pulls behind me. Lights aren't on, they just followed me. They had been behind me for 5 minutes, 10 minutes. And I pull into my driveway, I get out of the car. The police officers pull up behind me in the driveway. They turn the car so it blocks me being able to drive back out of the driveway. And the officer starts questioning me, "How'd you get this car? Where are you going?" They knew they were at the house where that car's registered. My mom knew I was coming home. She came to the door. When they saw her, they were like, "Oh, oh, this actually...this is your house? You live here?" And the older cop turned to the younger cop and said, "Okay, we're done here." And I have to imagine that the only reason that didn't turn out was because they could see that, yes, I actually did indeed live there. There was no reason for me to be followed home. I didn't get a ticket. They just saw me in a predominantly white area that wasn't "expected" and they decided to check me out, see what was going on. Did I cut somebody off? Was I driving too fast? Was my taillight out? Were my tags not up to date? Is my tint too dark on my car? Like, you go through all these things. Like, what did I do? But then at the end, you've got this gap. Well, what else could it be? And for some people, you don't have to consider that next step. You just say, "Oh, the cop is being a jerk." But I can't believe that. I can't. And I "have that card to play" but who wants to play that card? Playing that card is not on me. That was not my intention. And it was just unfortunate. You've done nothing. And that's your interaction with the police, that informs how you interact with the police going forward. Ask why those kind of things do happen. Maybe because you know me that you know who I am, maybe that carries a little bit more weight. Now, the story of somebody that you know and it's like, "Maybe I can do something so that Jason or somebody else doesn't have to go through this." Right? Now it's personal.

Beth: Right. I mean, these things are real. And I think it's important. It was one of the genesis of this podcast was to make it personal, right? To understand your colleagues' perspective, their experience, because you can work as you're saying, daily, professionally with somebody and not know that when they left work, that evening, they were followed by the police, for no reason. And this is their experience, sadly, probably more than once, and something the way that they have to walk in the world that you're completely unaware of.

Jason: Yes, it's tiring. And again, this is why I talk about the race card, like, no, that's not it. That can't be why, that can't be why I'm treated like that. Like, there's got to be something else. But then when you really dig down, that, that was probably it. That was probably it.

Beth: I want to express to you my gratitude for your courage and your profound presence within MGAC. I'm so grateful to have had this time and just appreciate you so much, sir. Thank you, Jason.

Jason: Thank you very much.

Beth: That concludes this podcast of "MGAC Inner Voices." Thank you so much for joining us and please, check back next month for another episode of "Inner Voices." Until then, take care.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-reese-ba8a2965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Reese</a>, MGAC’s newest Vice President of Business Development. Tom comes to MGAC’s Seattle office with a diverse slate of experience in the built environment. His 25-year career, deeply rooted in the Pacific Northwest, spans business development, project management, project operations, and public sector work. Within his new role at the firm, Tom will build on MGAC’s strong existing partnerships in the Puget Sound Region, while simultaneously seeking out strategic growth opportunities.

“At MGAC, we know that the best leaders are those who can truly relate to their team because they have had their boots on the ground and lived a range of experiences firsthand,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/ashley-o-connor/69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley O’Connor</a>, Managing Director. “Tom has rolled up his sleeves to do the work. He has represented clients and has overseen teams. He is as well-rounded as one can be in our industry, and we are eager to see him hit the ground running as he looks to strategically grow our Seattle office.”

“It’s an exciting time to come onboard with MGAC,” Tom says. “There’s innovation everywhere you look in the region, and the team in place here in Seattle is uniquely suited to take on the groundbreaking and forward-looking projects the Pacific Northwest has become known for. My previous experience has taught me the importance of a highly engaged team, and as someone focused on building on our portfolio and capabilities, I look forward to empowering every team member to be a key player in our growth.”

Originally from the small western Montana town of Alberton, Tom has called Kirkland, Washington, home for the last six years. While not working, you can find him staying active across a variety of outdoor pursuits. An avid skier, Tom volunteers as a ski patroller EMT each winter. He also keeps busy training for marathons and triathlons, and chasing after his golden retriever, Maxwell.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-newland-9090ba1b2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Yusuf Newland</strong></a>, Manager, Accounting and Financial Systems at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span></strong><strong>Hi, Yusuf! Welcome to the Impact Blog. Can you tell us what you do at MGAC?</strong>

<strong>Yusuf Newland (YN): </strong>Absolutely. My title is Manager of Accounting and Financial Systems. Essentially, I help manage the accounting system and the accounting team, and coordinate work processes to achieve our team’s goals

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>And how long have you been with MGAC?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I’ve been with the company, in our DC office, a little over four years now.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What led you to this company and role? What were you doing before you came here?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I moved to the U.S. in 2016. I’m from West Africa—I was born in Sierra Leone, and then moved to Gambia. Before MGAC, I was working for SOS Children’s Villages International as the financial advisor for the West African region. It helps provide care and resources for orphaned and abandoned children.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Wow, that sounds like incredible work. </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>It was. I was mainly working with a virtual team that’s spread across diverse locations. I traveled quite a bit, mostly around West Africa, and occasionally to the east or south. A couple of times, I went to Europe because our head office is located in Austria.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So, what brought you to the United States?</strong>

<strong>YN:</strong> I moved to the U.S. for family reasons. I took a couple of months looking for work to come into the labor market. Ultimately, I learned about a temp opening at MGAC. The company had recently changed its accounting system to the one I’d used at my previous job in Africa. They were looking for someone who had good knowledge of accounting and that specific system to help them through the transition phase.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What a timely opening! Was finance always your passion, or did you have other career ambitions when you were younger? </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>Actually, when I was younger, I was fascinated with how things move—how planes fly, how cars move. I was interested in physics and engineering. But, I grew up in a poor family, and you need many sponsorships to continue your education and ultimately do that kind of work. One day in high school, my older brother sat me down and suggested I make a switch to business studies instead—because I would be able to finish my education and get a good job. So that’s what I did.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So, unfortunately, you weren’t able to follow the path you were hoping to in your adolescence. But, it still seems you’ve been able to have a very rewarding career in spite of that?</strong>

<strong>YN:</strong> I absolutely have. And when you think about it, it’s still all about numbers, but instead of physics, in this case, it’s about business, how the numbers help make better business decisions!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Very true! What else would your kid-self think about your current job today?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>It’s incredible to think how far I've come. Especially the journey of gaining knowledge and growing through the process. In my prior role, I started as a staff accountant and rose to the rank of regional financial advisor/controller. During that time, I learned everything I know about accounting, management, finance,people and systems. All of that helped me establish myself and go straight to work when I came to the United States.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> What a journey! Speaking of, did you ever imagine in your younger years that you would one day move to the United States?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>Not in my wildest dreams! It was a big move, especially at my age, and a total transition of everything: lifestyle, culture. It’s easier to move when you are younger because you adapt quickly. When you’re older, you have ideas in your head already.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>So true. It’s an understatement to say you’ve had to overcome challenges in your move to the U.S. and onboarding with MGAC. What have been some of the most significant? </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>First of all, there was the work itself. When I first joined MGAC, I knew I needed to make an impact right away, even while I was still adapting to such a new environment. I came to provide a service to add value—otherwise, I wasn’t needed! To do that, I studied the goals of the department. I knew I had to understand where they were in order to properly understand where they wanted to go—and most importantly, how I could help them get there. Today, I find myself taking on challenges in order to grow in my role. I’m always seeking to better understand the industry MGAC is in, to have that context. For example, during the pandemic, I learned about processes in construction management. Because I see myself as a service to the other departments, and that means I need to understand them properly in order to give them the best information I can. It’s like they are my clients within MGAC.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What a thoughtful way to view your role. It’s impressive that your desire to understand the industry and your co-workers has inspired you to seek out ongoing learning opportunities. </strong>

<strong>YN:</strong> I’ve even studied some psychology to understand how to better deal with people and, ultimately, improve my interpersonal relationships. When I came here, not only were the people new to me; the culture was new to me. It wouldn’t have been the same challenge as if I were from the United States.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s so true. Can you elaborate on the cultural differences you encountered?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>Of course, all organizations are different in terms of culture. But, when you go to a completely new geographical place and then enter a new organization, everything feels different. The way people interact, how they come in the morning and say “hi” to one another, how they socialize, how they ask questions. It’s often about language choices. I realized I would use words that people aren’t used to here—that our jargon is different. As I mentioned earlier, I grew up in Sierra Leone, and later moved to Gambia, where I spent most of my adult life. Both countries were colonized by the British, so English was our official language, but I was used to British-English phrases. So, I studied the American-English jargon that people use here. Needless to say, communication styles and expectations were a big cultural challenge for me!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Even though that has been a lot to navigate, your diverse experience is also a huge asset to MGAC. What unique perspectives do you feel you brought to your team?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>In some ways, my previous experience working for SOS Children’s Villages International is nothing like MGAC, because MGAC is in the private sector. So, like I mentioned, I’ve been learning about the construction industry and business world. In that regard, it has been a completely different experience for me—like going back to school. But at the same time, the strong experience I had with the financial system and its processes meant I could make an impact at MGAC right away. I felt comfortable asking questions and had immediate ideas about improving the processes, developing the team, and training the team.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>It sounds like you were truly able to hit the ground running from day one! Flash forward a few years, what keeps you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>My role at MGAC has evolved over the years. I started here as a temp, helping with that transition to the new system. Then I came on full-time as a senior financial analyst. More recently, our team has grown as new people have joined. I’ve been adapting my work style to continue to work well with new colleagues. I’m helping to build new processes, to improve the accounting department, and to support the continued direction of the company overall.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>You also are leaving a great impact through your involvement with the company’s </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/"><strong>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</strong></a><strong> efforts.</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>That’s true. I help organize and drive a session of the DEI Lunch &amp; Learn every month. It’s a role I’m really enjoying. I think it’s fitting for me to help the organization support ways for its employees to empathize with one another. It’s good to judge people based on their own journey, and I’m someone who comes to work having made a significant journey to be here. That’s the starting point for our work on the committee.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely! Can you tell us more about it? </strong>

<strong>YN:</strong> Its overall aim is to help us understand each other more and be more inclusive. We’ll look at topics, videos, and other materials that help us collect our thoughts and share our ideas. The goal is to help us understand each other, to step into each other’s shoes, and to hear each other’s inner voices. Because while we're all at MGAC now, we each traveled to come here. Everybody has a different route. And we don’t always know the route another person took. It’s important we don’t judge people who arrived late, or who are not in the right mood. When you understand the journey, when you understand what a person is struggling with, you can put yourself in a position to respond to them empathetically.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What impact do you hope to have here at MGAC?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>When I think about my work with MGAC, I think of myself as someone who offers support to others. I am mostly working with colleagues internally, on the project management side. I’m a backstage worker. I’m here to support MGAC’s goals, and so my own goal is how to get others the information they need and make their work easier.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>MGAC has absolutely shaped me. This was my first working experience in the U.S., so I see this world how MGAC sees it. MGAC has shaped my worldview, my business view, my American view. Most importantly, MGAC has supported me as I adapted to life here and tried to settle my feet on the ground. I have felt like I'm in a family. I’ve gone through difficult moments in my transition, both personally and professionally, and MGAC has been always there to support me. I know they will always have my back. That moral support has been a strong foundation for me to do my best work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I think the most important part of my job is the fact that I’ve learned a lot and have built confidence in myself through that process. MGAC has inspired me to do more. They’ve given me a new vision of where I want to take myself in the next few years. What I can do more of. I think the most rewarding thing for me is the backbone of support they’ve given me to create a vision of myself.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>That’s great to hear. Beyond that support system, what gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>What makes me get out of bed and pick up my backpack to go to work is the fact that I have something on my desk to attend to that someone else is counting on. I know I'm making an impact, and I'm appreciated for what I'm doing. Because my work is ultimately about supporting others, I like seeing the ways I make someone else’s jobs easier, how their work and goals are improved through my background support.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>After work, my brain can be so active. I'll often go home and take a jog to relax. But I can also be comfortable watching Netflix or the news on the couch.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I’m an early riser—I can get up as early as 4:00AM. I always try to keep my brain very stimulated. My work can be creative: I have to find solutions, improve processes and make work easier for others. I always get up in the morning and do a quick, intensive workout to get my blood flowing and infuse fresh oxygen into my body.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Interesting! Many people wouldn’t think of accounting and financial work as creative, but you do. Can you tell us more about your perspective there? </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I think that’s what has kept me engaged in my work. I ask myself, “How can we do this better?” This industry is one of constant change that requires new solutions. MGAC has grown by more than 50 percent in the time I've been here. The firm has expanded its market, including into the private sector, a lot during that time. With this expansion comes an opportunity to build systems and improve processes to support the way we’re evolving.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>As we’ve discussed, you’re no stranger to lifelong learning. What’s a book that has made a significant impact on your life?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I listen to a lot of books. One that has made a lot of impact on me is <em>The Four Agreements</em>. It talks about four agreements, or four ways to look at yourself and approach life. I try to always keep them in mind and even have them on the wall in my office so that I will remember them throughout the day.

They are:
<ol>
 	<li>Be impeccable with your words. Speak nice. Your words should motivate others.</li>
 	<li>Don’t take anything personally, even if someone is rude to you. What people say or do is not about you; it’s about them.</li>
 	<li>Never make assumptions. Confirm everything.</li>
 	<li>Always do your best, no matter what. Even if your best is not enough and it doesn’t work out, you will know you did your best.</li>
</ol>
<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Those are great! They are simple, but powerful reminders. Along those lines, how about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>Because I work with accounting systems and numbers, I’ll say to my team, “Garbage in, garbage out.” It’s what you put in that you get out. With systems now, there are a lot of fields. Those allow you to break down information into many different variables. But people will still want to take shortcuts and put scant information in. I’ll remind them that systems depend on input—“garbage in, garbage out.”

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I’m very passionate about helping people. Supporting them, giving advice. I took a Myers-Briggs test, and I am INFJ: the Advocate. So, for me, I find greater good in helping others. Helping them figure out a problem. Brainstorm. Dissect and analyze. Look at something from a different angle to ensure a better outcome. I hope to measure my impact by how much I have supported MGAC from where they were when I joined them and the role I played along the journey to where they want to go. The systems and processes I've helped put in place. The people I've helped as they try to do their work and contribute to the MGAC goals.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Well put. And now we’ve approached the final phase of our conversation: Our rapid-fire questions. Are you ready? </strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I am!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span> Describe your job in 5 words or less</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>People, processes, systems, and information.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I look at my calendar and see what is ahead for the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the last thing?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I always ask myself, “What have I done for the day?” Sometimes there are things I have not completed, but I like to give myself a tap on the back and say, “I’ve gone much of the way, and I'm almost there.”

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>A little positive reflection!</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>Yes! I actually have templates that give me percentages of where I am with my goals.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Of course you do! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>In my pack, I would say my first-aid kit. I have it so I can help people, if needed.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>It's crazy because I am not a fan of lunch, so most of the time I have snacks like nuts throughout the day. I try to eat as healthy as possible.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I would say it’s WhatsApp. I have most of my family back home on it, and I use that to communicate with them.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What is your biggest work goal underway for 2021?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>My team has been growing a lot—we have a new CFO who’s been here about one year now, a new controller, and a lot of new other people. My goal is to support the team during this time. Helping my new colleagues integrate within our company culture and feel comfortable shaping and contributing to that culture by sharing my own experience and knowledge.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>As I said earlier, MGAC has helped me to create a new vision of myself. I think in the next five years, I want to get my MBA and put myself in a more strategic position at MGAC; so I can play a more influential role and help the company achieve its goals.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>YN: </strong>I'm an introvert, and I'm always serious at work. But I have another side: I can be very social, and switch from a serious person to the life of the party. People are surprised and ask, “Is that Yusuf?” Once, MGAC had a team in a soccer tournament. I was very active in helping organize the team and playing, scoring goals. Everybody was surprised!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit some of our most memorable <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FF&amp;E Procurement</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relocation Management</a> projects.</em>
<h4><strong>Would You Like a Job? How About 74?</strong></h4>
MGAC’s first major <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/ff-e-procurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FF&amp;E Procurement</a> job came in 2007—in the form of 74 projects—all for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). 144 years after its founding, the OCC was ready to renovate its headquarters in Washington, DC along with district, field, and satellite offices scattered across the country. It was no small task, with MGAC engaged as a partner providing, Relocation Management, FF&amp;E Procurement, and installation support.

The headquarters consolidation work consisted of an in-place renovation and re-stacking of the nine-story, 396,000 SF headquarters building and an expansion into 62,000 SF in neighboring leased facilities. MGAC’s FF&amp;E team was responsible for procuring all new furniture, maximizing the reuse of existing furniture, warehousing surplus furniture, and disposing of excess furniture through the established General Services Administration program.

For the OCC’s district, field, and satellite offices across the country, MGAC managed the furniture procurement, delivery, and installation process, which included producing an Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) manual and handling all warranty issues for the year following the installation. In the end, the team worked in 74 locations. More than 6,000 pieces of furniture, 1,600+ offices and workstations, and 1,200 employees were involved. Despite the scale of the work, no detail was overlooked, and every employee returned to a moved or renovated workstation to find everything exactly as they’d left it—down to their pencil on their desk—so that no one would miss a beat.
<h4><strong>Civic and Government Gigs Galore</strong></h4>
From there, our civics classes in grade school continued to pay off. We worked with the U.S. Department of State, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/white-house-visitor-center/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House Visitor Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/u-s-equal-employment-opportunity-commission/66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/fannie-mae-/70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fannie Mae</a>, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-intelligence-agency/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/defense-advanced-research-projects-agency-darpa-/209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DARPA</a>, and others, offering FF&amp;E procurement services over the years.

Just last year, the<a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-on-the-move-martin-luther-king-jr-memorial-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library</a> reopened its doors after a three-year renovation of the historic Mies van der Rohe building. MGAC was tasked with procuring all FF&amp;E for the renovation of the 427,263 SF building. By the numbers, the project counted 55 private offices, 165 workstations, 2,500 bookshelves, more than 550 library tables, 375 lockers for staff and visitors, 1,850 pieces of seating for visitors, and even a trash compactor—a first for the FF&amp;E team.
<h4><strong>Going Corporate</strong></h4>
Our FF&amp;E team’s first foray into the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate space</a> came in 2009 when <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/hilton-worldwide-headquarters/191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilton Worldwide</a> was ready to move its headquarters from Beverly Hills, CA to McLean, VA. There was a six-month timeline for us to provide site selection and real estate acquisition, project management, program management, design and construction management, relocation management, and, of course, furniture procurement. In the end, the transcontinental move was a success. Two hundred employees were moved, and a new 118,000-SF headquarters ensured Hilton's own workspace rivaled the experiences the company is known for offering its guests across the globe.

Another large corporate project kicked off in 2013 when <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-greetings-headquarters/190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Greetings</a> made the decision to move its world headquarters from Brooklyn, a suburb of Cleveland, OH, to nearby Westlake. The FF&amp;E team would be responsible for outfitting the entire 657,000 SF headquarters and creative studios. Each corporate team had entirely unique workplace needs to be addressed and the team worked on everything from c-suite offices and state-of-the-art conference rooms to video production studios and even a retail store. There were massive prop rooms, printing equipment, and all kinds of unique features for the FF&amp;E team to work with while on an active construction site.

Just a few weeks before the scheduled move-in, a propane tank at the site caused an explosion and a brief fire on site. Fortunately, no one was hurt or found to be at fault for the extreme and unforeseen event, but it pushed the construction timeline out by 11 weeks. At the time of the explosion, MGAC’s FF&amp;E team had 64 tractor-trailers on their way for install in the space. The team, who’d been based just across the street from the site, immediately went to work to navigate this sudden and significant setback.

A local warehouse was secured to house all the furniture and equipment that was no longer able to be immediately routed to the building, and the team re-sequenced the entire move-in plan working around just one freight elevator and a much more active construction site. The new timeline entailed working floor by floor, moving in as each was able to be occupied again. In the end, 1,800 employees moved into a new, state-of-the-art headquarters seamlessly.

The successful delivery of these projects has led to more corporate work and, today, we are providing FF&amp;E Procurement and Relocation Management for the renovation of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile’s Headquarters</a> in Bellevue, WA and a confidential new Global Headquarters and R&amp;D Center.
<h4><strong>Highly Skilled, Uniquely Nimble</strong></h4>
Over the years, MGAC’s FF&amp;E team has worked across <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/#nav_markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every sector</a> the firm has served. Including their work on American University’s Hall of Science which has brought even more firsts for the FF&amp;E team including freezers that must be kept at strict temperature ranges to protect the life’s work of research teams, massive fish tanks housing all kinds of live sea creatures, and chemicals requiring special handling.

Beyond civic and corporate projects, MGAC has also offered FF&amp;E Procurement and Relocation Management services for educational institutions, cultural spaces, luxury living properties, and more—each time, working on behalf of the client to ensure no detail is overlooked and that every deliverable is of the highest quality and value.

While some FF&amp;E teams might offer a scope that only touches the most commonly procured items, MGAC is nimble enough and skilled enough to deliver on any ask. By definition, the categories of furniture, fixtures, and equipment are broad and can truly entail any number of things. True to MGAC’s nature, the FF&amp;E team never backs down from—and, in fact, thrives—when thrown a new challenge.]]></content:encoded>

And welcome back to "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast digging into the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. As always, I'm going to preface this podcast by letting articles news now that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we're just here to share our stories, our firsthand experiences and discuss how together we're creating a better outcome from all of us in the AEC industry. My name is Bryan Gamez [SP], I'm your host. I am an assistant project manager at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today, I'm going to be interviewing and we have a special privilege of speaking with my co-worker coming from Valley office, Suling. So hi, Suling. How are you?

Suling: Hello, I'm well. How are you?

Bryan: I'm great. I'm so happy to be interviewing you or just talking with you.

Suling: I know, it's good to see you again.

Bryan: Good to see you. So can you tell us a bit about yourself and to our listeners?

Suling: My name is Suling Pong and I am the senior manager of creative services here in the LA office for MGAC. I've been with MGAC for a little over a year, but I've been in the industry for over 15 years now.

Bryan: Suling, can you tell us about your backgrounds and who you are, what groups you identify with?

Suling: Sure. So I am a female Asian American of Chinese descent, and I am part of the marketing and graphics realm within the AEC industry.

Bryan: And how has your identity as a female Asian American affected you in professional spaces? What challenges have you faced in your career because, or seemingly because of your identity?

Suling: So, I feel like I've been pretty fortunate to not have experienced a whole lot of discrimination for being Asian. I was born and raised in LA and I was raised very Americanized, I'm first generation on my father's side, but I'm third generation on my mother's side. So, in terms of feeling culturally different and feeling like an outsider in certain situations, especially in the professional realm, I'm lucky to not have felt that a whole lot. I think I was struggling more with Asian identity as a younger child, especially in my teens. I think that that was just a rougher time to be different or to really accept who you are. And now as I'm older, I've definitely appreciated my culture and my heritage, and I'm embracing that more and I can't even speak Chinese and I feel shameful for that. Like, that's a part of me and I should know how to speak it, but I don't.

Bryan: You touched upon you're third generation on your mom's side, first generation on your dad's side, but I think that you can find a balance and also celebrate your heritage. Which you said that you're doing now. You know, I was just speaking to a fellow co-worker and she's from Canada, but was raised in Mexico and she identifies as Mexican, even though she's Canadian. I'm similar where I was born here in America, I'm a first-generation American and I see myself as an American with my Latino cultural heritage. So, I celebrate who I am. So that makes me happy to be who I am. So I hope that you also are striking that balance. I wanna know, have you ever face discrimination in the workplace either by being any of your backgrounds? And this has come up in other podcasts about gender experiences and also even ageism. Do you believe that ageism is an issue in the work environment?

Suling: Oddly enough, I feel like I felt more of the ageism happening than discrimination because of my race or because of being female. I think that because I look a lot younger than I really am, my interactions with certain individuals, even though I may have more experience than them at the end of the day, they would treat me a little bit differently because I looked younger, they assumed I was younger, and therefore, I had less experience than them. And so, they always kind of tried to take over a conversation and the collaborations weren't truly collaborative in that sense because they always felt that their opinions mattered more because they thought that they had more experience.

Bryan: Unfortunate. That's honestly very unfortunate. I mean, you speak about having 15 years of experience in your field and ageism, you know, that's something that I may be a male, but I feel like I've experienced that as well. How has that impacted your career? Those situations are uncomfortable. You say that, you know, situations aren't as collaborative. Do they speak over you and how do you handle that situation?

Suling: It's discouraging. I think I just have to keep trying. When I did experience some of that, it definitely took a toll on my confidence and it made me question how vocal I wanted to be in meetings, how much my opinion was taken seriously. So, it's just about persistence and kind of just reminding myself that I do have enough knowledge to speak on this intelligently and that regardless of how people may perceive it or take it, or if they would just kind of overlook what I have to bring to the table, I just have to keep trying. And hopefully, that persistence will pay off, but also that others will eventually just come to recognize it. And I can only prove myself through more experiences. So maybe the first one is, you know, kind of blown off, but then as I keep proving myself over and over again, I think it'll hopefully start to sink in with people.

Bryan: I love, Suling, that you have confidence in you that you have the ability to speak out, and you always should because, at the end of the day, there's these people speaking in your head and also potentially someone who's really doing it, but don't let that person sitting across the table stifle you in any way. I mean, that's how I feel now. So I hope that our listeners can take this to heart when it comes to ageism, it has a real opportunity to stifle people's growth. And that's not how...if we're all about equity and inclusion, it's about ensuring that everyone's voices are heard.

Suling: In terms of being female for being Asian, my first job out of college, myself and another female Asian were hired together. And so we were pretty much the newbies fresh out of school. So I didn't feel alone or tokenized in any way. If it was just me and I was the only Asian on the team, which I would have been if it weren't for her, I wonder how that might've changed things. I'm not really sure because I never really thought about it. So it's just interesting. I had a peer, that we were kind of like in cahoots, you know?

Bryan: That's interesting because that has stuck with you for the last 15 years and you're using that as a moment right now. So, have you stayed in touch with that person?

Suling: Yeah. We're such good friends.

Bryan: Have you ever had a conversation about, you know, working together and how that's affected you now?

Suling: Yes, totally. I mean, she was not born in America. She was from Korea and her English was not as strong. And so, we always talk about how we grew so much together. She reciprocated that appreciation for having each other because she said, "You brought me out of my shell. You helped improve my English. You gave me the confidence I needed to be more vocal." And so I think that's just really cool. And she helped me embrace more of my heritage and my culture and my Asian upbringing.

Bryan: I love that. You guys were advocates for each other and I think that's how we should all be in the workplace. I hope that's the trajectory we're all heading down. Have you ever experienced a difference between men and female leaders?

Suling: So, on the topic of men and women, first of all, I was astounded when I learned that there is this huge wage gap still between men and women. I mean, I thought we've come so far. I'm gonna be honest in saying that because I haven't really experienced any sexism or anything in the workplace. I never was aware of the statistics until it came to the forefront more recently. As I've gotten older, I start to question, why aren't I seeing as many females in leadership positions at the C-suite level? Why are there only a few? There are far more females on this earth, period, than men, we that for a fact. So why is it so outweighed in the workforce? Part of it is because a lot of women leave the workforce when they have children, but I think that's changing because of need and because of want. So why is that still the status quo where men are dominating?

Bryan: I think that's the issue. I think that men use an excuse, that because women leaving for different desires or want, or for having a family, but that to me is no excuse for not to have a female leader in the C-suite. If anything, that mother has much more persistence, determination because she is a working mother, and not to say that the fathers don't, but I come from a family where I have a hardworking mom and she is amazing. And I think that I really resonate with working women, and maybe it's because I'm gay and I have better connection with women. But I agree with you. I don't think that there should be the wage gap...I think that we're working on it as a nation, but it's also like societal and cultural issues that are just ingrained in corporate America. And we're working on it.

Suling: I agree with you because I've heard you say this before that women do things differently. We're just kind of programmed to be a little bit...we function a little bit differently. There's a strong difference between how women think versus how men think. But that being said, when I have interacted with women in leadership roles, I really look at the example that they are providing, not only to me, but other aspiring women to really rise to the top or whatever their aspirations may be. I always wonder, "What does it take to get there? What does it take to get a seat at the leadership table? Do they need to act like men? What attributes got them there?"

Bryan: I mean, that's a really good question. And have you thought about those answers because I'm curious now what you think that may be? Because if you asked me that, I don't really think of it as men and women, I think of it as determined, ambition, good listener, and whatnot. And I hope that everyone does too. But what answers have you come up with for your own questions on how to get to the top?

Suling: I have to say that I've been very fortunate to work with a group of really intelligent, strong women. And so, I feel like I've grown as a woman myself because of that. They helped shape who I am today and they've been mentors to me, we've been great advocates and supporters of each other. And then, unfortunately, I have some experiences with women who are not so pleasant and they are one of the few at the top. And I feel like sometimes women feel the need to defend themselves and they kind of get possessive about it a little bit. And I feel like women with those responsibilities and the abilities that they have to empower other women and support and encourage, I think they should be doing that more. And so, it really makes me sad when you meet a female not doing those things.

Bryan: Suling, that's a really good segue into my next question. Suling, so there are many challenges that women face. What are those challenges that they face in the workforce to have them behave or act in a certain manner that makes an experience unpleasant? And have you ever experienced any of those in your career? And I mean, it sounds like you have.

Suling: Yeah. I mean, very few, but it's a very strong type of personality where they're trying to clearly dominate as opposed to support. So that's why I question, are those the kinds of personalities that these men are looking for when they bring someone up to their level? Is that something that they're looking for, those attributes? And so it kind of defeats the purpose of why you want women up there in the first place because women bring a different perspective and it adds to the richness and the diversity of ideas and collaboration. So if you're only looking for people that are too similar to you, you're doing a disservice to yourself and the firm and to everybody.

Bryan: You hit the nail on the head there, Suling. I agree with you. I think, first, when I think of a leader, I don't want them to be dominating. I don't want them to be micro-managing. They should let you be as innovative as you want to be. They should be a great listener, engaging, communicative. And there are times where you meet...my experience has been a lot of men who wanna be aggressive and their personalities are explosive. And you just think, you know, at the end of the day, I realize I don't really wanna work in this environment. So, you know, you may be a leader here, but in the real world, that's just not gonna cut it for me. And as I get older, I'm learning from these experiences of what not to be, what a leader should not be like.

Suling: Exactly.

Bryan: And that's how I take it. And I'm like, moving forward, I know that when I surround myself with my co-workers and my colleagues, I want them to work with me because they like to work with me because I'm listening to them. So I think what you just said resonates with me. It's about having a richness of diversity up at the C-suite level, it should not be similarities of personalities because as you said, I believe that's a disservice to the firm. Segueing into my next question. Why is diversity, equity, and inclusion so important in the workplace? Can you describe your professional service in the firm and how do you believe your service can help impact DEI through the AEC industry and beyond, and also your personal work?

Suling: Yeah. So this is interesting because the conversations have been mainly about ethnicity, race, and discrimination based on those things, but there's a lot to be said about inclusion or the lack of amongst the roles that each of us play in a firm. I think that the more we can be inclusive of everything in totality, the happier employees will be and the stronger the firm becomes. I've always been in in-house services of a firm. You know, we're not part of the core company service, we're not "the moneymakers," right? We're behind the scenes, we're the cheerleaders. In my experience, it's funny that our colleagues don't even understand what we really do.

We're a marketing team. We have the graphics component in there. We have communications and public relations within that. We are a hybrid of multi-disciplinary skillsets. And I think when it comes to architects or project managers, they often forget that we are just as vital to the firm as they are. And that there is the tendency to overlook or to have this unspoken bias about who we are and our roles versus theirs. And that goes for human resources, or accounting, or IT, any of the support services that some may consider ancillary services, you are there to support us. It's not like that at all. I would challenge people to think that we all need each other. We can't do what we each do without each other.

Bryan: I'm really happy that you shared that because I think in our field, when I was at GC, we had a few folks who did a lot of marketing and they were the face of the company to clients, to the public. And while you talk about it being an ancillary service, I think that you are just as valuable as the project managers, right? And I think that's unfortunate that you have felt that way, but I'm happy that you can share that here so that everyone understands that I don't know if we don't have the right to be questioning someone else's role and whether or not they're as valuable as a project manager within the firm, right, because you're just as valuable.

And your talent and your skillset is as valuable as the next person who is sitting right next to you, Suling. And so I'm happy that you're able to express that. What measures can people take to help others understand the value that you bring to the table, can you tell us why you're an asset to our team?

Suling: When it comes to what I specifically do or graphics-related, it's difficult because graphics design, it's all very subjective. People make comments, people have opinions, and we're always open to hearing them and incorporating them in. But where do we draw the line? At the end of the day, who has authority over graphics? And I don't think that people are aware when they make comments or questions certain things that we clearly know a little bit more about than they might. We're trying to provide that area of expertise to them. And sometimes it's hard to convince someone that they can trust us and that we know what we're doing.

Bryan: You know, I hope that's not the case all around. And I hope that people do trust you. I mean, I'm enjoying this conversation with you, Suling.

Suling: I'm not saying that we experience that all the time, there are just a few select people that will challenge us from time to time and almost forget that we are there because of what we can bring to the table.

Bryan: As I said, your role is important, just as important as other services within the firm. So I hope that when that happens, that also takes a little education, a little bit of communication, and also engagement with that person because their position is also predicated on what you're providing to clients. So there's just an understanding that needs to be maintained there. I think that's all about dialogue. It's unfortunate that you've experienced that. And I hope that you've had the opportunity to address that. How do you address that? How do you address that?

Suling: We definitely try to be as collaborative as possible. We're gonna be like, "Okay, Hey, we hear your concerns. Let's try to address and resolve your concerns using what we know and what we think is best." And it's not necessarily moving that exactly where you tell us to move that, or writing it exactly using these words. We're going to bring it all together and make it the strongest product it can be. We're looking at it holistically and we're trying to maintain a certain level of quality and consistency throughout.

And we sometimes get vetoed, but we try our best to at least explain our side of things. And at the end of the day, we will just have to do what it takes to make everybody happy. Sometimes behind the scenes, like, marketing graphics tend to be, we're not the ones that take all the glory, you know, the people that interview or the ones shaking hands with potential new clients, they're getting all the glory. And that's great. We're happy with that. We're good with that. But just don't forget to thank those who helped you get there along the way.

Bryan: It's a team effort.

Suling: Exactly.

Bryan: Right. It's a team effort. I mean, it's all about...at the end of the day, it's about inclusivity and equality. You're sharing a common goal and you're sharing a common purpose within the firm. I do want to ask you, what advice would you give people want to pursue a career, a marketing career in the AEC industry who, you know, are worried about facing discrimination?

Suling: I think as long as you're getting yourself out there and showing that you understand the business, you understand what they do, and you try to educate and inform people of like what you can bring to the table and how you understand what they're saying, and we're gonna take what you're trying to convey, and we're gonna package it in this really beautiful thing that is going to win new work and get new clients. We just have to put ourselves out there. It is about reminding people what you can bring to the table, making sure that they know that you know what you're talking about because you understand the construction industry, you understand architecture, you understand the basics of like everything that they're talking about. And I think that's when they'll feel like, "Okay, in you I trust."

Bryan: So where do you see our industry in 10 years' time or even 15 years' time?

Suling: I think that we'll see a change for sure, in 10 to 15 years. It's not gonna happen overnight and the change might not be huge, but we'll start to see more people of color, more females. I think we need to do that.

Bryan: How does that become an action plan? I know that we've spoken with others that it's about first sharing these experiences and having these conversations, but maybe it's also conventions or forums.

Suling: I think that people need to remember to keep an open mind and have an honest conversation with yourself and ask yourself, "Am I potentially contributing to the problem?" Even if that means you've chosen to do nothing, has that even been part of what's the problem? And having conversations, very open dialogue conversation, and you don't have to go all out with whatever kind of change you wanna make, or however you want to contribute. It can be 1%. I think that people feel like, "Well, if I'm not going to go all in or be hardcore about it, I'm not going to even bother." But that's not true. Even just a little bit makes a difference. And maybe if you put 1% in here one time, maybe you'll want to up that and you'll do 3% next time and you'll just keep raising it. But the more we become familiar and teach ourselves how to start thinking in a different way, I think that'll help.

And including minorities, we all have a responsibility to put ourselves out there, right? To break out of our familiar communities and clicks, both professionally and personally, so that we can break down the barriers and perceptions. I want people to get to know me as a person, but if that means that I'm their first Asian friend and I show them that we have just as much to offer and that we have more similarities than you may think, that was hard to break down barriers and people will start to be more open to different cultures, even though at first sight it's not familiar to them. Or they may assume that they don't have any similarities, but we can find those common ground.

Bryan: Yeah. I agree with you. I think not saying anything is probably part of the problem, but it's also understanding that when you are engaging with someone, definitely don't try to pass judgment on them on who you think they may be because that also plays into it, right? That's also the perception that you've created in your own head about another person. We're human and that does happen with myself. And I always catch myself. I think back to Oprah, it says a lot more about yourself if you are passing judgment on someone, and that's important to note and where is that coming from? Is it coming from a fear? Is it coming from being uncomfortable? And it's you really have to break through that barrier to understand, you know, what is our common goal? And here our common goal is to really be successful together. That's a great point, Suling. I'm happy you brought that up. How do you think companies can bake DEI into their DNA?

Suling: I think we're trying the best that we can with forming a committee and having these podcasts and having these DEI calendars that go out to spread the awareness. And to just speak about things out in the open so they don't become so taboo, ripping that band-aid off and just like going for it.
Bryan: And I think we're going for it, Suling. I think we are. I think what I've really loved about this podcast is listening to everyone's perspective, right? It's not just about sex as a single, you know, national origin. It can be about socioeconomic statuses. And also internally, you've talked about say your role in the firm and also ageism, it's all about making everyone feel inclusive. And this is what we're doing here at MGAC is really creating that safe space for everyone. They are trying and we're collaborating amongst each other and providing a space to share, as you said, cultural dates with the calendar and also this platform to speak about our experiences.

Suling: And I think that we're figuring it out as we go too because there's no right or wrong way to approach this. So we're just kind of feeling it out and open to more ideas and thoughts on how we can be better. So I like that you're asking this question of everybody that you're interviewing, because there may be, really, new ideas that we can be bringing to the table.

Bryan: Because I always think about this question, like how do you bake it into a company's firm? And I'm gonna be kind of honest here. I hope that this podcast doesn't fall on deaf ears with leadership. My genuine hope is that 5 or 10 years from now, really, that there will be more minorities in leadership positions. We deserve it because of our performance, but also because of our perspectives. And I hope this is gonna leave a lasting impact on the AEC industry as a whole. And that's my genuine hope. And I say that in all sincerity.

Suling: Oh, yeah. I agree.

Bryan: Can you speak to increasing diversity and representation while avoiding tokenization? You know, you talked about how you were hired with your friend and you didn't feel tokenized.

Suling: Yeah. I almost wish that we can change up the recruiting system where it's kind of like the voice where it's you don't know their name, you can't look them up and see their photo on LinkedIn. It's just purely about their experience, their education. And if that impresses you, then, you know, look into them more. But it shouldn't start with the name because that's where I feel like...that's what can ruin things if people are discriminating against things. You can't see them, you don't know their names. I mean, my name too, like. My name is very Asian. Sometimes I get mistaken for a man. And then I wonder if they think that I'm gonna need sponsorship because of my name. And so, they automatically dismiss me, you know?

Bryan: That is such an interesting point, Suling. Like I don't...you know, my name is Bryan, but, you know, I've actually never thought of that before. That's an interesting point that you bring up because how I hope that people don't think that way, but that's the truth of the matter of the fact is that that's probably what has happened.

Suling: Even subconsciously, right? They may not be aware of it and that's playing into their decision-making. So it really should just be about your achievements and your experience.

Bryan: Absolutely. And I agree with you.

Suling: And I think that if they were to just focus on that, then you would see a lot more diversity and then the more diverse the firm is as a whole, the more diverse the leadership should become within that if it's all relative, I would think.

Bryan: Yep. She's got a point. She's got a point. We have co-workers who probably have never experienced discrimination or any negative treatment. You know, what advice would you give them to be an ally?

Suling: I would say, keep your eyes open and don't live in your own world. Try to really understand their side of things and not make excuses for others and speak up for them when you can and if you can. However you can. Also reaching out to these people that you see are experiencing this, reach out to them and tell them that you see this and ask them how you can help, show that you care so they don't feel alone. And so that they feel like they have the support they need to keep that confidence going and to not lose the faith.

Bryan: I think, you know, you bring up a really good point. I think some people don't realize that others may feel so isolated, that in a workplace you can make someone feel isolated and not, in turn, creates a terrible working environment for them. And on at the end of the day, everyone wants to be heard, right? Everyone wants to be listened to know that they matter. You're right. Everyone should lend a helping hand and also understand that it's really about engaging with the other person and their experiences. This sounds really cliche, but if you don't know the person, you know, put yourself in their shoes or ask, you know, not even you don't have to just ask and create the communication create the dialogue.

Suling: Yeah. Even if you have an inkling that something might be happening, just ask them like, "Hey, is what I think is happening, is that what you're experiencing or...?"

Bryan: And I think that we're really touching upon all these aspects on this podcast. And with that Suling, it's been such a pleasure talking to you today. I'm really happy that you came on and shared your experiences with us. We talked about ageism. We talked about, you know, your professional surfaces and that's something that we really haven't discussed before, maybe potentially briefly, but I think that you're bringing up these topics that are worth discussing and worth having people really dig into. So I appreciate your candidness. And also, I think you are very eloquent in everything you said.

Suling: Thank you. I'm glad to have been a part of this and I'm glad I can do my part however I can.

Bryan: And I appreciate it so much. And with that, thank you for listening to this episode of "MGAC Inner Voices." We really appreciate you guys listening, and I hope that you guys come back next month for our next episode. Bye, everyone.]]></wp:meta_value>

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hello. I'm Mike Etherton with MGAC and Hardy Park in Washington, D.C., let's get moving. Hardy Park is a five-and-a-half-acre site run by the Department of Parks and Recreation. It has a rec center, outdoor basketball court, two tennis courts, and a 7500-square foot dog run. The playground was renovated around existing trees with a nature-inspired theme and ADA-accessible for 2 to 5 and 5 to 12-year-olds, keeping close attention not to damage one of the oldest living elm trees in Washington, D.C. The athletic field was regraded to a plus or minus 2% grade for competitive soccer play. Surrounding the athletic field is a walking track with many outdoor exercise stations. The splash pad was built with over 40 spray features and was designed with a recirculating water system to conserve water use. It provided an ADA-accessible community garden for all ages to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables. And finally, a custom pavilion designed to resemble a butterfly for outdoor gatherings. I hope you enjoyed seeing what's happening at Hardy Park. Follow us to see MGAC's next move.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Grab your backpacks and freshly sharpened pencils; it is time to go back to school! For our friends at <a href="https://dcps.dc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DC Public Schools (DCPS),</a> the hallowed hallways of some district schools may look a little different this year. Since 2017, MGAC subject matter experts have been providing technical support to the <a href="https://dgs.dc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DC Department of General Services (DGS)</a> and DCPS on the stabilization and modernization of various school projects throughout the district. These projects are focused on providing key upgrades that will empower and inspire DCPS students and faculty.

To date, MGAC has delivered the following projects: <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-capitol-hill-montessori-at-logan/237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Montessori at Logan Elementary School</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-eliot-hine-middle-school/242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eliot-Hine Middle School</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-jefferson-academy/239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jefferson Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-john-eaton-elementary-school/241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Eaton Elementary School</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-john-eaton-elementary-school/241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Lewis Elementary School</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-thaddeus-stevens-school-early-learning-center/238" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thaddeus Stevens School Early Learning Center,</a> <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dc-public-schools-dcps-van-ness-elementary-school/244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Van Ness Elementary School</a>, and various other modernization work, and nearly 20 stabilization projects.

On Thursday, August 26<sup>th</sup>, two of these completed projects, John Lewis Elementary School and Eaton Elementary School, held ribbon cutting celebrations that were attended by Mayor Muriel Bowser and DGS Director Keith A. Anderson.

John Lewis Elementary School, previously known as West Education Campus, was renamed after the late civil rights icon and congressman. The modernized school now reflects a 21st-century learning environment with educational spaces as directed by DCPS’s Educational Specifications. The building is approximately 90,000 SF, spread over two floors, with 32 classrooms serving more than 350 students in grades Pre-K through 5<sup>th</sup> Grade. John Lewis Elementary was designed and constructed to be highly energy-efficient and produce onsite, carbon-free renewable energy in an amount sufficient to offset the school’s annual energy use. It is the first DCPS school to achieve net-zero certification.

Anderson at the ribbon cutting celebration of Eaton Elementary School.[/caption]

The modernization of Eaton Elementary School, a $57.7M project, initially began in 2018 after the buildings were showing the effects of time, general maintenance issues associated with age, and several insensitive interventions over the years. The modernization included the renovation of two existing buildings totaling 40,000 SF and the demolition of interconnecting 1930s- and 1980s-era buildings that allowed for the construction of a new 45,000 SF three-level building. The new facility features a new gymnasium, library, and cafeteria to serve the student body.

“We cannot wait to bring our students back to fantastic facilities like this one—spaces specifically designed to support the needs of young learners,” said Mayor Muriel Bowser.

MGAC has a dedicated team of project management professionals that continue to focus on supporting the development and completion of these DCPS projects.

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/navedrahmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Naved Ahmed</strong></a>, Cost Consultant at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong><strong> It's great to have you on the Impact Blog, Naved! Tell us about your role at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>Naved Ahmed (NA): </strong>I'm a cost consultant in the San Francisco office. I'm responsible for all things <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=13">Cost Management</a>, including creating initial estimates, providing benchmarks, assessing the design as it progresses, reviewing contracts with the subcontractors, and getting purchase orders, invoice reviews, final payments, and more! I work both with project managers and directly with clients.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> And how long have you been on board?</strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> I started in December 2018, so I'm coming up on three years soon.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> So, was working in the built environment always a natural career path for you, or did you even know this world existed when you were younger?</strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> Actually, my dad was a project manager on an offshore petroleum drilling rig. I would hear him talk about pipelines bursting, and in my mind, I thought he was a plumber. For a little while, I thought, "Maybe I should do that!" But a few years later, I realized what he did was totally different. So I guess, as with all things, you learn a few things as time passes.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Interesting! So you followed in his footsteps, to an extent.</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>In a way, yes. His work was related to construction, and I work in the construction industry. But being out in the ocean every day and risking my life is not exactly for me!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Understandable! What would that kid think about your current job today?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>I think I'd be pretty impressed, to be honest. For example, even just five years ago, I never thought I'd be the cost lead on a multi-million dollar project.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> That's no small feat. And on that note, what's keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Since I came on board, I have worked almost exclusively on <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-headquarters/205">T-Mobile's New Headquarters</a> in Bellevue, WA. It's such a massive project. There are nine buildings that cover around 1M SF of usable space. The client is fantastic and has a vision of creating an eco-friendly, engaging, and collaborative workspace for their employees. Their amenity space is better than many dedicated amenity spaces that I have seen. It's pretty incredible!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What's the timeline on your work with T-Mobile? Is the project in its final phases?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Cost, by default, goes on a bit longer than other elements of a project. But at this point, we are looking to wind down a bit. We're almost in the home stretch, with the biggest building going entirely online / occupied by the first quarter of 2022. It's remarkable to see everything come together. The footprint of what our MGAC team has worked on with T-Mobile is pretty impressive!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> You mentioned that cost goes on longer than other elements of a project. What does your role look like over a project's trajectory? </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>At the beginning, we meet with the client to discuss scopes and budgets and how everything lines up. Then, as the project proceeds, I'm responsible for getting the contracts executed and working with vendors directly for invoices and payment, among other things. And in the end, once construction activities are complete, we have final payments and account reconciliation. You look at how actuals compare to original budgets, basically determining how much it actually cost the client to do the project.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What fresh perspectives do you bring to your work with MGAC? </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>As a consultant, in many ways, my primary duty is to convey factual information in an easy-to-understand format. For example, costs are all about numbers, but our clients don't always want to see endless sheets of numbers that they may or may not understand at a glance. It's my job to develop visualizations that help everyone comprehend what those sheets mean. So, I'm always thinking about ways to distill information and make it easier for the client to process the numbers to ultimately make a decision.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Ultimately breaking complex information down into what truly matters for the client. </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Exactly. I know that not everyone wants to know about the last 50 cents that are being allocated here or there. But when you're proposing something and the client asks, "Can we afford this?" you should have a simple answer: "Yes" or "No."<strong> </strong>

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like you've really found a natural fit in your role at MGAC. When you take a step back, what impact do you hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>At MGAC, we always put the client first. We are their trusted advisor. I am constantly motivated by that and aim to uphold that trust in everything I do. Our clients depend on us; they take our word to be the right one. When you present all possible options and make a recommendation to a client, and they understand and agree with you, that's a great feeling. T-Mobile is an excellent example of this. They've worked extensively with MGAC and have given us a lot of responsibility because they trust that we'll make the right decision. It goes a long way in building a true partnership. I'm always happy to be a part of that.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>I find that I seek out challenges. They inspire me. I'm not very fond of repetitive, "rinse and repeat" work. Instead, I'm always trying to think about something I can improve upon or do better for our clients or how to look ahead in a project.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Great outlook. What have you learned along the way?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>There is no one correct answer. This is especially true in construction, where there are so many people involved and so many ideas. It's important to hear everyone out. Just because you've done something previously, that doesn't mean it's the only way out there. You can always take up suggestions, and you might just find a better way to solve a problem—and learn something new in the process.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Building on that, how do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>As I mentioned earlier, our work for T-Mobile has everything to do with creating more engaging, collaborative workspaces for its employees. I hope that by creating something so unique and amazing, it inspires others to do the same. Indirect karma, in a way! But it makes sense: If you really enjoy your work, you tend to share that. And that might end up being the inspiration for someone else to do something equally remarkable.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Very true. Have you found that kind of inspiration at work? </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>The freedom that you have to do your job. You have the opportunity to take on amazing projects here. MGAC's perspective is, "Do you know how to do it? Then go do it!" You're granted a license to work on so many different things and truly grow as a person through that experience. This also means that everyone is super motivated. And when I see others as excited to work on a project as I am, their motivation rubs off in a good way.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your work with MGAC?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>There's nothing like seeing your work come to fruition. To go on site and see something you thought about at the start of a project, perhaps a year and a half earlier, be fully implemented. And to see it turn out amazing. It gives you an incredible sense of accomplishment when you're passing by that building, and you can say, "I was part of the amazing team that executed that project."

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Quite literally, I start every morning with a cup of tea—Indian-style, with milk. It's funny because I used to avoid caffeine. But it's safe to say I'm now addicted to tea. In terms of work, I'd say being involved with really cool projects with a great team and client.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>My house is pretty close to a public park with a tennis court. I try to play either tennis or badminton every day. It also gives me an excuse to have an elaborate dinner! Which is great, because I love to cook as a way to relax.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>It's pretty simple: Going through my day and prioritizing my work. When you have many things to do but no plan for getting it done, it's easy to get overwhelmed and not accomplish anything at all. So the first thing I do is look through my calendar to see what meetings I have and check my emails to determine priorities. From there, I'll make a list for the day. Once I have a general direction of what I want to do, it gets easier.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> I've learned a lot from reading <em>Extreme Ownership: How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win.</em> It's about how to make the best of every situation. Many people tend to say, "That's not my job, not my responsibility." But this book teaches the value of truly taking ownership of your work—and your life. There are real-life situations about Navy Seals woven throughout. It's about thinking for yourself and your team, because you cannot win alone.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>A couple come to mind. "No one can save you but yourself" and "This too shall pass." I try to remind myself that some situations are out of my control, and I just have to make the best of what I can.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>I would like to think I'm someone who can be counted on and depended on by others. And at MGAC, the systems I put in place or some of the visualizations I did are just that. They are useful for those coming after me and my hope is that they can help them in some way. There's always room for evolution and improvement in this field. Even considering my work with T-Mobile, the things we used to do when I first started versus today are quite different. I hope to always stay ahead of those changes and, in turn, help my colleagues and clients continue to do great work.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! At this point in the interview, we'd like to ask you a few rapid-fire questions. Are you in? </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>I am!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in 5 words or less. </strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> Solve problems, get everyone paid.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>I'm not a person who cleans out my bag very often. You'll find receipts from three to four years ago, old chocolate wrappers. Who knows!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> Anything fried. There's a really nice taco place that was near our old office—I'd find myself going there every day. And I do dream about Nashville hot chicken from Howlin’ Ray's in Los Angeles.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Twitter. You really find out how funny people are. The sheer number of one-liners and witty comments—it's a great way to relax.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Top 2021 work goal? </strong>

<strong>NA: </strong>Well the year is almost over, so I guess getting ready for a final push to end on a high. Bar the COVID-19 restrictions, get in touch with people and work on unique projects that may come my way.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Tell us something your colleagues don't know about you.</strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> I have taken up software coding as a hobby these days. I'm trying to make my own apps that can automate some of the things I do, from investments and personal finance to my work to-do lists. There are so many apps out there, but I'm keen on customizing a few.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Very cool! Finally—where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>NA:</strong> Considering how the last year and a half has gone, I'm super open-minded on what can be. One thing that's for sure, I still want to be working with amazing people and with amazing clients. Who knows, with all the billionaires wanting to go to space, maybe they'll set up a moon base soon and MGAC can be part of the team!

<em>January 12th, 2022 - The skybridge connector is officially open!</em>

The skybridge connecting building 2 and 3 at <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile Headquarters</a> has officially opened to employees and visitors! Scroll to see the evolution of the skybridge that stands 66 feet in the air, and measures 185 feet in length, making it one of the longer and more technical skybridges in the Bellevue area.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4870" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_11_18_B2-B3-Connector-3-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" />

<em>December 2nd, 2021 - Building 2 and 3 connector nears completion. </em>

The<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> T-Mobile Headquarters</a> project team is putting the final touches on the connector between building 2 and 3 with completion expected in January. Once complete, the new connector will increase accessibility, reduce travel time for employees, and keep employees dry on rainy days.

<em>May 14, 2021 - Final steel trusses are lifted and set. </em>

Yesterday, the<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> T-Mobile Headquarters</a> project team lifted and set the final span of steel trusses that completes the bridge structure between Buildings 2 and 3 at their Bellevue, WA campus. In keeping industry tradition, the project team celebrated the “topping off” occasion with flags, company banners, and the classic Christmas tree; all flown through the air with 26,000 pounds of steel!

This is a major milestone for the project team with the riskiest scope behind them. This also kicks-off the envelope work that involves roofing, flooring, and encasing the bridge in a glass curtain wall. Even more noteworthy is the fact that this is the final point of connection for T-Mobile staff and employees; the B2-B3 connector is the final link to traversing across four of the major buildings on campus, enhancing the workplace connectivity, collaboration, and accessibility!

<em>March 11, 2021 - Construction begins on first span of the skybridge connector.</em>

Last Thursday was a significant moment for the<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-bellevue-headquarters/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> T-Mobile Headquarters</a> project team, as construction began for the first span of the skybridge connector between Buildings 2 and 3.

This entails a massive effort including building and raising roughly 81 tons of steel beams, in four phases, on top of scaffolding towers between two existing building façades at varying elevations. At its highest point, the skybridge will stand 66 feet in the air, and will measure 185 feet in length, making it one of the longer and more technical skybridges in the Bellevue area.

“This was a huge milestone, and I’m very proud of the project team for working through all of the mind-boggling details of engineering, design, logistics, and planning to get to this moment! Hats off to the <a href="https://www.andersen-const.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andersen Construction</a> team, and their partners at <a href="https://apexsteel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apex Steel</a> and <a href="https://snellcrane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snell Crane</a>, for conducting a successful and safe hoisting operation!” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-wieneke-pmp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz Haeck</a>, MGAC’s Project Manager for the skybridge connector.

This will be a game changer for T-Mobile employees who will now have a more accessible, seamless route between buildings, and the ability to more effectively connect with teammates across campus, all without having to step outside into the elements!

The skybridge was designed by the <a href="https://www.gensler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gensler</a> Seattle team in collaboration with <a href="https://www.kpff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPFF Consulting Engineers</a>. Completion is expected in early 2022.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that MGAC is expanding its leadership team and welcoming our newest Vice President, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/cynthia-montanez/101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cynthia Montanez</a>. Cynthia will be based in our San Francisco office and comes to the team with over two decades of industry experience having worked as both a general contractor and an owner’s representative, most recently with Kylli, Balfour Beatty, and Cumming. To date, Cynthia has worked across multiple sectors on nearly three dozen projects in and around the Bay Area. In her new role, she will be focused on helping to expand the team and portfolio of our growing San Francisco office.

“At MGAC, we grow with the addition of individuals who not only complement our team, but push it further,” says <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/jeremy-oliver/98" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Oliver</a>, Senior Vice President. “Cynthia is someone who does just that. Her background affords her a unique perspective on our industry. She is a proven problem-solver, and the enthusiasm she brings to her work is infectious. We are thrilled to have her on board.”

“Throughout the course of my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects—everything from small tenant improvements to multi-building campuses, schools, hospitals, and everything in-between,” says Cynthia. “I have worked on teams both big and small throughout the Bay Area. What excites me about joining MGAC is not only the range of sectors the company has experience in, but the quality of work they deliver—and the sheer talent behind it all. There is so much opportunity in San Francisco, and I look forward to working alongside this team as we continue to grow MGAC’s presence in the Bay Area.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit <strong>the evolution and growth of our work in Canada. </strong></em>
<h4><strong>GOING INTERNATIONAL</strong></h4>
Since 2010, MGAC has been delivering successful projects and building relationships throughout Canada. It’s a journey that, today, includes an impressive portfolio of projects that span infrastructure to hospitality to higher education, an office relocation to Toronto’s emerging Junction neighbourhood, and the growth of a diverse and dynamic team that prides itself on delivering projects that positively impact communities. It’s also a journey uniquely representative of the greater Toronto area, known for its strong business value, excellent education system, rich and diverse talent pool—particularly technology, and heavy government-led growth and investment. Let’s revisit the evolution of it all.
<h4><strong>THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK</strong></h4>
Two of our early projects truly set the stage for our presence in Canada. Back in 2010, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/international-financial-organization-primary-data-center/58" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TD Bank</a> approached MGAC for damage control on a data center project that had gone awry—to the tune of two years behind schedule and more than $42M over budget. (File this one under: You’ve got your work cut out for yourself.) We immediately got to work organizing the existing project team to get the schedule and budget on track, introducing the commissioning agent as a direct representative for the client’s facility operations team, and developing alternative delivery strategies that reduced the schedule by six months. By project’s end, we delivered the full building under budget and on schedule.

We were off to a running start—and not slowing down any time soon. The team was already underway providing project management services on a $72M performing arts and teaching center for Queen’s University in Kingston, ON. Poised on the shore of Lake Ontario, the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/isabel-bader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isabel Bader Center for the Performing Arts</a> was conceived to support the growing needs of the student body through dedicated teaching, rehearsal, and performance space for fine arts, film and media, drama, and music—and engage lovers of the arts in Kingston and beyond. The <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/isabel-bader-centre-architect-wins-award-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award-winning project</a> executed the dramatic vision of acclaimed Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta and Ottawa firm N45.
<h4><strong>REACHING NEW HEIGHTS AND HAVING A WHALE OF A TIME (LITERALLY)</strong></h4>
Our team’s success delivering the Isabel Bader Center for the Performing Arts helped us land the project management contract of a new Core Science Facility for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/memorial-university-of-newfoundland/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN)</a>, a $250M research, teaching, and laboratory building on MUN’s St. John’s campus. With its three separate towers linked by two vertical atria, the building design is firmly rooted in place, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mun-core-science-facility-csf-design-inspired-icebergs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drawing inspiration from icebergs</a> found off the Newfoundland coast. The multi-phase project has exemplified making missions real, perhaps best illustrated through the suspension of the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/blue-whale-arrives-to-core-science-facility-at-memorial-university-of-newfoundland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82-foot, 2,000-pound skeleton of a rare blue whale</a> in the atrium of the facility. Nearing completion this year, it sets a new standard of excellence for campus facilities and enriches educational opportunities for current and future students.

Another higher education engagement, this time for Toronto’s <strong>Ryerson University</strong>, involved the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/ryerson-university/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transformation of a parking lot into a 29-story mixed-use tower</a> that housed academic, administrative, residential, and retail spaces, and included four levels of underground parking. Our cost management team notably achieved a 10% reduction in cost through value-engineering workshops.
<h4><strong>VALUES AT WORK: PROJECTS WITH A PURPOSE</strong></h4>
Our team has been fortunate to partner on projects that reflect and serve the unique needs of the communities we have worked in. Much of our early work started there, and it’s within this space that we continue to thrive. That purpose is also fulfilled in the civic and government work we have undertaken across Canada. Our team has helped <strong>Canada Post</strong>, the country’s primary postal operator, embark on a transformative journey to embrace evolving technologies through renovations of existing facilities and new builds. We work with the <strong>City of Toronto</strong>, upgrading outdated infrastructure at wastewater treatment plants. And, we will soon begin offering scheduling services to the <strong>City of Barrie</strong> on their portfolio of projects which include upgrades to public buildings, roads, and wastewater treatment plants. The team is also delivering cost management services for various agencies that execute public infrastructure projects, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, courthouses, and more.
<h4><strong>LOOKING AHEAD </strong></h4>
Toronto is abuzz with innovation and opportunity, and a recent office move has placed our people in the heart of it all. From <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgacs-toronto-team-moves-to-new-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our corner of the Junction</a>, we can continue to take on the kind of work we love to do: impactful projects that unite stakeholders around a shared vision. While some teams shy away from projects with many perspectives and moving parts, we embrace them. We know we can serve as the string that ties together phases and stakeholders, because we have done it time and time again.

From data centers to performing arts centers, hospitality to infrastructure work, our Toronto team has proven it can tackle projects across sectors and of all scope and scale. Our people are the reason. They are trained architects and engineers providing client representation, development services, and full project management services. Our Toronto team, who understands the full scope of the project process, can be with you from project inception to final close-out. With diverse professional backgrounds and areas of expertise—but the same passion and drive for client advocacy—they comprise a well-rounded team with the vision and know-how to execute the biggest “What if?” down to the last detail.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Beth: Hi, welcome to "Inner Voices," a podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. This is brought to you by MGAC. I'm Beth Scully coming to you from Seattle, Washington. I serve the company as a senior project manager, and want to begin our podcast with a disclaimer. We are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. I, as a cisgender woman, can speak from my personal experiences and do my best to help our participants share their experiences as well.

Our hope is that by sharing our stories, we encourage and explore ways that together we create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. Today we have the privilege of chatting with Amanda Goldsmith. Amanda is a vice-president at MGAC and will be representing a Jewish woman's perspective in the AEC community. Hi, Amanda.

Amanda: Hi, Beth. Thanks for having me.

Beth: Thanks for being here and welcome to the podcast. Can you share with our listeners a little more details about yourself, what you do, how you do it, and just anything you want to share about yourself here?

Amanda: I'm Amanda Goldsmith, a vice-president of cost management in DC, which is our headquarters' location. I've been with MGAC for two years. And about 15 years prior to that, I've held positions on both the owner-developer and general contracting side, which really has, I think, provided me with a great perspective on some of the challenges that our industry partners face on some of our really complex building programs.

I also am really privileged to serve on a board for the Women in Construction Conference, which is Mid-Atlantic's forum for education, professional development, and networking for women in the build industry, and we really seek to empower women to continue to grow and achieve success in the community.

So, of course, I'm really passionate about that aspect. And as I do represent women in construction, there is another group that I also represent, as you mentioned, and it's not as discussed in the workplace. I think it tends to be a little bit more off-limits in many people's perspective, and that is my identity as a Jewish person, which has a whole different set of challenges.

Beth: I want to begin our podcast by helping our listeners understand a little bit more about your background. You didn't set out to be a woman in construction in the industry, did you?

Amanda: I did not. I initially had started in an admin-type role. It was at a general contracting organization, and I was supporting the pre-construction group and really thought what they were doing was more interesting than what I was doing, and my career kind of took off from there, but I certainly had some challenges initially trying to make that transition and be accepted as a woman in what is a male-dominated field.

Beth: So how has your identity as a Jewish woman or simply a woman affected you in professional spaces?

Amanda: It's really kind of multifaceted. That's an interesting question. When I think through some of my employment history and also interactions in the construction community with subcontractors and others, as a woman, it's often assumed that especially being younger and as I was coming up in the field, that it was always the admin role or I was the one there to get coffee or take the notes.

And there's certainly that level that could have probably held me back had I not been a very strong-willed person and willing to kind of speak up and just pushing myself forward in my career, and along the way, had some really great mentors that were supportive of my path. And that's part of why now I'm so passionate about giving back in that same way and serving as a mentor to the next generation that may not understand some of the awesome opportunities that we have in this industry.

Beth: I think there's true power in the sharing of stories so that people can understand. I think particularly for younger women as they come up, I would like for you to reflect on those experiences. I'm thinking of the construction group in college and being asked to get some coffee at a firm.

Amanda: Right. So I guess early on, as I said, I initially realized that I maybe wanted to take this different path and go out into the field a little bit more, learn more about some of the boots on the ground construction side of things and be more involved in the technical. The firm that I was with when I was kind of looking to explore that, and I brought it up with the leadership there, they weren't open to it. I immediately got the reaction of, "But you're a woman and that's really not the place for you."

And, again, I'm a very strong person and I was brought up that way. I have brothers that I grew up with that helped instill in me that I was not going to be held back by that, and I basically at that same moment without another job lined up to go to, I looked that gentleman in the eye and thanked him for letting me know what I needed, and submitted my resignation at that moment to be able to pursue something that I felt was really more in line with what I would really excel at. So I fortunately then went to another national general contracting firm, and from that point just had the ability to really grow and have some experiences in the field and grow my career from that.

Beth: Like I said, powerful woman. I mean, to have the inner strength as a young woman to say, "Thanks, you've given me that information, I'll be submitting my resignation," it's just exemplary of who you are. So I'm wondering, did you ever report any of the incidences that you experienced or you maybe chose not to?

Amanda: I never did. Now, I think that especially years ago when I was early in my career, I think there was still a bit of a mentality that there would be retribution. That if I reported it, it would maybe fall on deaf ears and what would that get me? So I just chose to find a path that aligned with where I needed to be. It wasn't easy by any means, but certainly, something that I was willing to put in the work for.

Beth: Having not reported it, did it have an impact on your feeling safe as you move forward?

Amanda: I think for me, the impact that I felt is being a bit more guarded. Over time, I've certainly become more open because I think that that's a service I can provide to others who may be in that position of not feeling they can be open yet or not feeling that they have the safe space to talk about some of these issues. So I do feel that it's really important, and so appreciate the opportunity like this today to just have an open dialogue. And hopefully, if even one person can gain a perspective that's changed out of this, I think that it's a success. It's worthwhile.

Beth: What would you tell your younger self now?

Amanda: I think what I would say is it's really important to always be authentic, be your true self, and keep those aspects of your identity because there's so much to be gained by having that level of openness. And it's not always going to be easy or comfortable, but I think that that's...you know, the uncomfortable is sometimes where we make the biggest strides.

Beth: So I want to head off into another place that you and I also discussed and chat with you about holidays if we could.

Amanda: Sure.

Beth: And the challenges that you have faced there.

Amanda: Absolutely. So, of course, being Jewish, we have a different set of holidays than what many in the United States celebrate. There's a lot of Christians, and the recognized holidays are primarily the Christian holidays. So when my biggest holidays of the year are occurring...are holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, which are in the fall, and there have been times when there's major meetings or presentations that are being scheduled that I'm expected to be a part of and it can create a conflict. How do you address that when it's an expectation or there's a thought that is this going to potentially have a ramification for the company if I'm not at that proposal presentation or if I'm not in this location?

But I actually have found when I bring attention to that, when we look ahead at the calendar, and if something is being scheduled and bringing attention to that, has in one instance that I can think of it actually was that the gentleman for the client that we were supposed to be presenting to was also Jewish. And when it was brought up, he was like, "Thank you because now I don't have that conflict as well. I wasn't going to be able to attend." So thinking through that, that's certainly a holiday side of it.

One of the other things that I think is really interesting is Christmas is such an important holiday for others. And if that's what's important to others and that's on the top of their mind and it's a great time of celebration and family, it's common for people to just naturally throughout the month of December to look at me and say, "What are you doing for Christmas? What are your plans?" And that does not offend me. I find that when I respond, sometimes people feel that they need to apologize, but I want to hear about what other people are doing. That's important to the people that I work with. That's important to my colleagues and friends and clients.

So I think it's important for me to be able to get to know them as to hearing about their plans, but I have no problem sharing that on Christmas I'm probably eating Chinese food and going to the movies because that's our tradition.

Beth: I love it. I love it. So what I'm hearing as I listened to you is that the onus in terms of scheduling and calendars is really on you, right? You have to be very proactive to look ahead and see dates. So how can people be more aware and sensitive about scheduling calendars?

Amanda: So we're talking right now about initially the Jewish calendar, but I, of course, have a lot of friends and colleagues who have other holidays that are not on the Jewish calendar, but maybe they don't fall in line similarly with other things that we're celebrating.

So I think being aware when you are scheduling something. If something is showing on the calendar and you don't know what it is, I think it's important just to ask. We can have that dialogue. There's other things that I think are pretty critical. There's some fasting holidays in some religions, so if we're having meetings to be respectful to individuals who may be fasting. And for example, don't schedule a big celebration during Ramadan when there may be people who can't participate.

A lot of this boils down to not being afraid to ask respectfully, of course. But if you're unsure, I think it's better to err on the side of caution and ask those around you, and then we can from that learn and move together in a way where it is that more inclusive environment.

Beth: How do we bring more sensitivity to dietary considerations around this?

Amanda: That one's always the challenge because, of course, so much of our culture revolves around sharing a meal. In a business setting, we may be having lunch together while we're working through a challenge and we're all in the room together. And I think it's important to just keep in mind that across the board, you don't really know what someone's background is. And maybe it's a health consideration, maybe it's an allergy, but it could truly be something also that as part of someone's identity, there are aspects that they maybe don't eat meat at all, or pork, or shellfish, or other things are not part of what they view as appropriate.

So just being mindful of that and providing options or asking people if lunch is going to be ordered, are there any restrictions? It's a simple question. And I think that there's no way that anybody could be offended by that because regardless of whether it is a religious reason or potentially a health concern, it's a respectful way to proceed.

Beth: It's important always to take a pause, and just, to your point, ask the question. People are not offended. In fact, I think it provides more inclusivity to be sensitive around these topics. So taking now a broader view of things, I want to chat with you about the advantages of diversity and ask you why is diversity, equity, and inclusion important in the workplace, in your opinion, and what value does it add?

Amanda: If we can show up as our authentic selves, as individuals contributing our voices in a safe place, it really does foster a tremendously high degree of engagement, which also then results in greater productivity, innovation, and that all contributes to the bottom line. So it makes good business sense.
From the aspect of just being a good human being, it also makes good sense for people to feel that they are included and that their voice matters. And we also then benefit from that diversity of mindset, and it can help us to solve challenges because we're now coming to it from all these different perspectives and backgrounds that I think are really important to allowing us to move forward in a really, really effective way.

Beth: How does your unique identity make you a strong asset to your team, Amanda, and how has it informed who you are professionally?

Amanda: Well, I certainly have a perspective on being a woman. I have the Jewish perspective. As far as some of what I do on a personal note, I also am part of a group of women that is a home-based national program of Jewish and Muslim members that meets together so that we can really build trust and respect and those relationships and understanding.

And I think all of that has helped me not only to understand those specific perspectives, but to continue to be open to all these other beautiful things that are occurring in the world and around me that really could benefit whatever we're doing, whether it's professionally or personally.

Beth: Bravo. So I know that in chatting with you I discovered you are a board member of ACE, I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about that and also your best story as a result of being part of that.

Amanda: So I'm not a board member of ACE, I'm a board member of the Women in Construction Conference, and the organization that we support through scholarships is ACE mentorship. So having that relationships of mentoring young women and seeing them grow through their high school career and then benefiting from a scholarship and potentially the internships in the industry and mentoring the next generation is just really, really amazing.

I have so many experiences with that, and I think the common thread that I find is when a young woman, an individual that potentially had no idea that this was a viable career, a viable field, that they could do something in the architecture, engineering, building, construction, any of those that are related to our industry, and to have that opportunity to just learn about something that is a fantastic profession that would allow them to grow and excel in the future, that is just so rewarding. And to be able to be a part of that is something I really do appreciate.

Beth: I know as a woman alongside of you, had someone like yourself existed that could have spoken to my younger self... You know, in my younger years, I wasn't as powerful as you, I would not have stood up and said, "Thank you. Here's my resignation." I swallowed a lot, to be frank, as a woman back in the day. So I just can't thank you enough for being part of that organization and for mentoring young women and being as broad-minded as you are beyond our work at MGAC with clients and colleagues.

I just want to express my appreciation for what you do beyond the workspace in encouraging young women in an industry where, you know, we're seeing numbers go down in terms of participation. It's awesome. So I want to talk about or ask you, what measures can our colleagues take when clients seem uncomfortable with diversity?

Amanda: I think in my experience when someone seems uncomfortable, it tends to be driven by a level of fear. Especially I think from our client perspective, it may be that they're worried about a misstep, that they don't want a PR nightmare because they've potentially messed up, said the wrong thing to an employee, a board member, a stakeholder, or the wider community, whether that's verbally or social media or some other method of communication. And that is really a lot of times, again, in my experience, that is really that underlying factor to that level of discomfort that can paralyze people into inaction.
So being uncomfortable is not the reason to do nothing. I think respectfully having a conversation to try to understand what's really driving that discomfort so that we can address it and then continue the dialogue and support the mission is really how we can deal with that in a positive way.

Beth: So I know you do this regularly because of your involvement outside of MGAC, but what advice would you give young people pursuing careers in the AEC industry who might be worried about facing similar discrimination that you have as a Jewish woman or just a woman?

Amanda: I think my biggest tip is don't be afraid or ashamed. Be who you are without exception. It seems simple, but I think really that's for me some of the best advice I can give. And that maybe for some people, it doesn't mean that they are completely open in having conversations like this. You can still be who you are and not have to compromise your own identity in order to achieve your goals professionally, and I think that it's about achieving that balance.

Beth: Obviously, we're having this conversation, and given where we are in this point of history, we are trying to normalize the conversations we're having, right? So how would you like to normalize these conversations in the workplace?

Amanda: Continuing to have the conversations, and when the taboo nature of a topic is taken off the table, I think that's where we can really have that honest, respectful dialogue and gain a greater level of appreciation and benefit from those unique perspectives.

So I think acknowledging that it's a journey and we're all at a different point on that journey, on that path. Some people, again, may be much more comfortable having an in-depth conversation. Whereas I do know a lot of people who are perfectly comfortable with their identity, but not comfortable openly discussing the topics because there can be negative connotation when some people hear Jewish or Muslim or Islam. And it's so unfortunate, but I think in order for everyone to really feel empowered, it's really critical that we continue the conversation at whatever level each individual is comfortable engaging in that.

Beth: I think it's fair to say that many of our coworkers may or may not have had personal experience with discrimination or negative treatment as a result of their identity. What advice would you give them on how to be an ally?

Amanda: I think speaking up as far as for someone who's seeking to be an ally, don't let fear of a misstep prevent you from taking action. If you're unsure of someone's comfort level, you know, quietly one-on-one maybe, respectfully ask them. Don't assume on another's behalf what they may or may not want a situation to be. So I think that's the biggest thing, is we need to really not be making assumptions. It is a lot about communication, and making sure that we are respecting these different perspectives that we all bring.

Beth: As humans, how do you think we increase our respect for one another?

Amanda: You know, it's really interesting because I'll go back to my personal involvement in the group of Jewish and Muslim women, where I think when you get to know someone at an individual level, it's really difficult to then have that misunderstanding because when you get to know someone and you see what makes them tick and their background and that family is also important to them or things that really are important to them at their core, whether it's you're in the workplace or at home, as we share that knowledge and friendship, we're able to celebrate that and lead to more equality there.

Beth: I feel like this is a question that you're already doing it, but what are your personal action items to get us to a place of more diversity, more discussion, all the things we're chatting about, more inclusivity, your personal action items? Maybe let's set it within the context of our company.

Amanda: So my next real mission on this in the context of our company in the context of our industry is that I think we are in such an interesting position to change the landscape of a built environment in a way that supports an inclusive and diverse environment.

So an example of that is we have the benefit of being involved in projects as they're taking shape from a design perspective, so we can facilitate conversations as the project manager, as the owner's representative, to potentially incorporate design changes that have a minimal cost impact, have a minimal impact really to those who wouldn't use necessarily the facility.

But something like a gender-neutral restroom or a meditation or prayer room, hand washing or foot wash stations, things like that that are really, again, relatively small impact to the overall design or cost of a project but could have a huge impact to the individuals and the end-users who are in that space as a means of making them feel that they have that level of

Beth: That's beautiful. I mean, it's just a natural way to help a company become more diverse. People would seek that out and see, oh my gosh, built into the very design of your building, I'm included, I'm seen, I'm heard.

Amanda: Exactly, exactly.

Beth: I love it. I love it.

Amanda: It's so powerful that we potentially have that opportunity to have that level of impact. I think that that is just one way that we can positively move things forward in that direction.

Beth: Beautiful. So I would love to hear what your hopes and dreams for the state of the industry in our company are in 10 years.

Amanda: Oh, my goodness. Well, going with what I was just speaking about, I'd love for that to just become part of the norm. That it's not something that is an uncomfortable conversation to people, and it's not something where we're raising our hand and saying, "Hey, but did anybody think about the gender-neutral bathrooms?"

I mean, I think it would be great if those things just became part of the fabric of what we're looking at and that, as an organization, that we really continue to embrace all of the differences that we have and the benefits that it brings to us by having such a diverse population within our organization.

Beth: Amanda, it's always a privilege and an honor to chat with you, but before we close this podcast off, I wonder if we can take a moment for you to offer any other thoughts, anything that you want to include in this podcast for others to think about before we close it off.

Amanda: Again, I think really it's about don't let fear prevent you from asking the question or having a conversation that could really change things for the positive. So having meaningful and intentional engagement with one another. It's not about statistics of saying, "We've checked all these boxes," it's about intuitively I think sensing, "Are we authentically engaging one another, and what does that look like, and how can we continue that?" I think it really does all boil down to open, honest dialogue and having that level of respect where we can have that safe environment for those conversations to occur.

Beth: Beautiful. Thank you so much, Amanda. This has been MGAC's "Inner Voices." And again, I offer my thanks and my deep gratitude for you, for participating with us, Amanda, and your beautiful articulation of some of the thoughts surrounding your personal identity as a strong, powerful Jewish woman in the industry. So thank you again for that.

Amanda: Thank you, Beth.

Beth: That concludes this podcast of MGAC "Inner Voices." Thank you so much for joining us and please check back next month for another episode of "Inner Voices." Until then, take care.

&nbsp;

<em>WASHINGTON and LONDON (Oct. 12, 2021)</em> -- MGAC, a leading North American-based owner’s representation, and project and cost management consultancy, has announced the acquisition of U.K. property and construction consultants, <a href="https://rlf.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RLF</a>, for an undisclosed, all-cash purchase.

The deal will bring the combined turnover of the business to $75 million and create a well-positioned global player in the project management and cost management space, with 270 employees in 10 offices across two continents.

“Our expanded business will create a formidable organization across two continents helping bring the most ambitious project visions to reality,” said <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Anderson</a>, president and founder of MGAC. “We believe, by combining tools and resources, we can add jet fuel in the form of investment and energy to the U.K. business to provide greater opportunities to our professionals globally, and to better serve our clients. We are very excited to welcome RLF to MGAC.”

Founded in 1885, RLF has 100 employees across four U.K. offices in London, Brighton, Birmingham, and Glasgow. RLF’s core services include cost management, project management, construction management, health and safety, and building surveying. A selection of their key clients includes University of Birmingham, Bruntwood SciTech, BAM Properties, Solum, The Institute of Cancer Research, and Hyde Housing.

The acquisition will retain RLF’s existing staff and 136-year heritage. Current RLF Managing Partner David Thomson has used this as an opportunity to announce his retirement, with RLF Executive Partner <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/sean-clemons/102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Clemons</a> unanimously being elected by the existing RLF partners as his successor. With the acquisition, Clemons will take on the role of Managing Director in the U.K., as the business enters a new and exciting chapter of growth.

“Today is an incredibly exciting day for RLF, and we very much look forward to working together with our new MGAC colleagues in North America as we continue to move forward and prosper,” said Clemons, managing director of RLF. “The additional investment, resources, experience, and infrastructure will enhance our offering to clients and broaden our sector expertise.’’

Among the key benefits to RLF from the acquisition is the opportunity to expand and enhance sector expertise including the key areas of corporate, hospitality, and data center work, where MGAC has deep relationships and a leading market presence. Upon closing the transaction, Clemons and the existing RLF leadership team will continue to run the company on a day-to-day basis, and all its services will be delivered under the RLF brand for the foreseeable future.

MGAC leadership did a tremendous amount of research and looked at more than 80 companies in the U.K. before engaging with RLF.

“We quickly realized RLF shared a common vision with our company and there was a real opportunity for a strategic transatlantic expansion,” said Anderson. “We have been working in the U.K. for more than 20 years, and we saw RLF as the ideal firm for us to establish stronger roots in the country and across Europe.

“RLF has a young, dynamic team that will only enhance the company as it broadens its service offerings,” added Anderson. “On the talent level, there is a formal education and licensing system in the U.K. around quantity surveying that we don’t have in the United States and Canada, so it’s exciting to be able to tap into that talent pool.”

Celebrating its <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/celebrating-25-years-of-mgac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25th Anniversary</a> in 2021, and privately owned, MGAC has 170 employees and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. with additional offices in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. MGAC specializes in project and cost management services including program and project management, project controls, cost management, schedule management, technology solutions, FF&amp;E procurement, and relocation management. The firm has completed multiple projects for 35 Fortune 500 companies, including two in the Top 5. MGAC is currently managing $15 billion in construction across North America; and has worked internationally for top law firms, real estate developers, and various U.S. government agencies.

Some of MGAC’s recent projects include the<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/t-mobile-headquarters-campus-renovation/205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> T-Mobile Headquarters</a> in Bellevue, Wash., the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/nfl-media-headquarters/223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL Headquarters</a> in Inglewood, Calif., and campus buildings at <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/johns-hopkins-university/222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johns Hopkins University</a>, in both Baltimore and Washington.

“Both MGAC and RLF are process-driven and are dedicated to taking clients to better outcomes, added Anderson. “We both believe in providing value, not cutting corners, so we’ll continue to bring unparalleled service and actionable intelligence to each project we work on.”

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentmclaughlin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Vince McLaughlin</em></a><em>, Assistant Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span></strong><strong> </strong><strong>Hey Vince! We are so glad to have you on the Impact Blog. </strong>

<strong>Vince McLaughlin (VM): </strong>Great to be here!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What do you do at MGAC, and how long have you been with the firm?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I’m an Assistant Project Manager, working on projects either as part of a team comprised of multiple MGAC staff members or independently. I’m based in the DC office, and I joined in May 2017.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What were you doing before you came here?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I was working with some general contractors in the area, learning as much as I could about construction. I have an educational background in architecture, and I always wanted to find out how buildings actually got built, beyond just how they were designed on paper. A family member recommended that I “put on boots and jump in a hole.” So, I started learning. While managing some warranty work, I experienced working directly with a client—helping them with their needs, solving their problems—I knew that was the path for me.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Very cool! So, was architecture always your passion when you were younger? </strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I always loved math and science. For a long time, I thought I'd be a doctor, like my dad. But in college, I took courses in architecture, and it was like a flashback to all the LEGO and popsicle stick houses and tree forts I made as a kid, and I was like, “I want to build stuff!” My mom used to tell me as a baby I was obsessed with trucks and heavy machinery. She said when she couldn’t get me to go to sleep, she’d drive me around to construction sites to watch the cranes and trucks.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Safe to say they don’t put you to sleep anymore! What would that kid think about your current job today?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I definitely think I did right by my younger self. It’s fun to go to work in a sandbox every day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> We understand you had a pretty exciting opportunity when you joined the firm?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>VM:</strong> You could say that! Four months in, I went to The United Arab Emirates to work on the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/bulgari-resort-dubai/182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bulgari Resort Dubai</a>. The project was already underway when I went over. Our client needed someone on the ground every day to ensure quality control and make sure all the systems, facilities, and amenities were online and up to their standards by the time they opened. Ultimately, I was there for seven months.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like that was a cool project to start out on.
</strong>

<strong>VM:</strong> It absolutely was. I mean, it’s a hotel, yacht club, and residential towers that sit on a man-made island in the shape of a seahorse. It doesn’t get more sandbox than that! It’s so crazy to help bring something like that to life. It’s the kind of thing I always dreamed of doing when I chose this career path and was really affirming after the time spent getting my sea legs in the industry. I’d recommend it to any bright young professional considering a project management or consulting career. Why not choose construction? Why not build something physical? Why not have the opportunity to always be working on a cool new project?

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> We’d tend to agree! So, what’s keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Right now, we’re down at the 555 Pennsylvania Avenue project, the former Newseum location in Washington, DC. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-named-as-program-manager-for-new-johns-hopkins-facility-to-be-housed-in-iconic-newseum-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is consolidating a lot of its graduate facilities</a> from Massachusetts Avenue. It’s been going on for just over a year, and we have until August 2023 to be ready for students. It’s a university building with heavy infrastructure needs (structural, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical). But there’s also an art component. We’re helping the design team relocate a part of the Berlin Wall from a JHU property across town. Not something you do every day—that’s for sure.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Amazing! Tell us more about your role on the project. </strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I have been in charge of the structural elements: the steel and concrete. It’s extremely extensive. The Newseum was so unique that, in order to repurpose the building, we had to take many of the existing bones out and put new bones back in. We currently have some <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/progress-update-on-jhus-555-pennsylvania-avenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">140 tons of reinforcing steel</a> holding the building together as we install the new steel and concrete structure.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Wow. What’s it been like working at such a high-profile location as Pennsylvania Avenue? </strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Being right on Pennsylvania Avenue has kept things interesting, to say the least. When complete, this will be the closest university building to the Capitol. But being so close to the Capitol means there have been no shortage of hubbubs, stirrings, protests, and road closures. It’s right in the middle of it all. We were on the inauguration route; we’ve had motorcades coming through—just about every week we’ll have someone telling us they’re closing the road for a weekend event.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> You’ve definitely got some stories to tell—and not just about this project. When you think about your time with the company, what at MGAC has most made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>VM:</strong> I’d say the leadership. Here’s an example. When the pandemic sent us all home, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Anderson</a> instituted the Squawk Box. It started as a twice-weekly, Roosevelt-esque fireside chat over Zoom. He spoke openly and directly about the goings-on of the company. In a world that had become so strange and uncertain nearly overnight, Mark answered questions and provided transparency on our path ahead. That kind of leadership fostered a lot of trust and confidence in my place here.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Transparency really can be so powerful, especially in times of uncertainty. And what a great way to bring people together! </strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>VM:</strong> Exactly. In construction, it’s not uncommon to feel insulated—like you’re only a part of your project team and not actively interacting with people throughout the company. But MGAC really tries to cultivate that sense of community. Of course, that wasn't always easy during the pandemic, hence the Squawk Box debut. Staying connected with my co-workers during the pandemic is one of the many reasons why I joined the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEI team</a>, and I’ve loved being a steward of that initiative. We’ve offered some really cool programs and helped launch exciting company-wide changes like the addition of pronouns to people’s signatures. My next big project with DEI is “Food that Brings Us Together,” a cookbook of recipes that are culturally or personally important to people within the company.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> We love celebrating our people—what a fun way to do it! </strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Yeah! I mean, we are a company of really cool people doing really cool work. I brag about it! Once I was on a recruiting trip to Penn State. The students were asking, “What part of these projects are you working on?” And I said, “The whole thing!” That’s one of the aspects I love about my work here. We can have a role in every part of it—and we often do. We make incredibly cool things come to life. I love to be able to drive around town and say, “I worked on that!”

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Across my career, my biggest challenge has been really having no construction experience prior to graduating college. My degree was art history and architectural studies. But in some ways, I’ve been all the better for it. I'd say my key to learning this business has been finding the right people—be they CEOs or ironworkers—and getting to know them, asking questions, and learning as much as you can.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Sound wisdom! What else have you learned along the way?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Whatever could happen, will happen. Every project has a dragon buried in it somewhere. You’ve got to find it before it finds you. That’s what I tell myself at the beginning of each project. There’s always something that will rear its ugly head at you; you’ve got to spot it and be prepared for it. And never assume anything. I’m learning every day. There will never be a time when I've figured it all out, which I love. This work is ever-evolving, and that’s exciting. I’m constantly humbling myself and reminding myself not to be afraid to ask smart people smart questions—or dumb questions, for that matter!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> A great perspective! And given the range of projects you might work on, there’s no shortage of opportunities to learn. When you take a step back and take it all in, how do you hope your work here will impact your community at large?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>We’re building spaces in which the human race can progress. I’m working with a major university to grow its advanced international studies program, which prepares people to work with others across the globe. I’ve worked on hospitality projects that invite people from around the world to unwind and recharge. MGAC has ongoing work with <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?keywords=DCPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DC Public Schools</a>. We’ve got our hands on a lot of projects in which we’re shaping the world and bringing the world closer together. We have every iron in the fire. I can’t think of a more direct way to make the world a better place than to build cool projects that people can enjoy, places where people can learn, do business, and live in.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>Honestly, a satisfied client. To see a literal building problem solved, to see the finished product come to life, that’s the best.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I have to keep moving physically. It might be running, hiking, or rowing—I even picked up rollerblading during quarantine. I ride my bike to work and get plenty of steps in while walking the jobsite!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I love cooking; it’s my favorite hobby. At home, I’m always putting on music and trying out new recipes. It helps my mind completely unplug from the day.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>It’s really about the night before—I have to go to bed at a time with my wake-up in mind. And in the morning, I know that it takes me exactly 14 minutes to ride to the jobsite with no red lights, so I need to get downstairs to my bike and kick the tires with that much time to spare. I’m hoping to get it down to 13 minutes before winter.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>There are many! Recently, I read <em>Normandy ‘44</em> by James Holland. It’s a pretty comprehensive overview of the invasion of Normandy. I read it in advance of going to Omaha Beach. Even with all that knowledge of the book, all the movies I’d seen, everything paled in comparison to being there in person. It was amazing, and an incredible way to define human sacrifice and human courage. It made me think a whole lot about that in my own life.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>My favorite Frank Lloyd Wright quote is, “I think Nature should be spelled with a capital N.”

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>I really invest in what I do personally, whether it’s cooking a meal or constructing a building. I hope my lasting legacy is that people know I was personally invested in every project, every part of my life. I’d also say that, like a good Schwarzenegger movie, getting called out of retirement would be pretty cool. I’ve seen retired industry people be asked to come back and run projects. That’s probably when I would know I did a great job.

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Now, we have a few rapid-fire questions for you to answer. Are you game?
</strong>

<strong>VM: </strong>You bet!

<strong><span style="color: #f22e00;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in five words or less.</strong>

<em>October 27, 2021</em>

The accelerated shift to remote work not only forced employers to rethink the typical 9-5 workday but also how they utilize their physical office. In-person connection and collaboration are on top of the list of things workers miss from the office. But how can we rethink in-person spaces for maximized collaboration? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-johnson-cio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Johnson</a>, CIO of Poly, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/steve-hay-/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Hay</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/alan-mougey/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Mougey</a>, Managing Directors, MGAC, answer this question.

Since March 2020, millions of offices worldwide have sat empty. Where once there was a hum of chattering activity — meetings and phone calls, huddles and watercooler chats, bustling cafeterias, and the endless tapping of keyboards — now there is a veil of silence hanging over vacant rooms. The pandemic has caused a permanent shift in how and where knowledge workers do their jobs, so when we finally return to the office, what will the space look like? Hopefully, it will look entirely different than when we left it, reconfigured for hybrid collaboration between onsite and remote teams.
<h4><strong>6-Step Plan To Retrofit Office Space </strong></h4>
While it may seem daunting to retrofit your existing office to improve hybrid collaboration, this six-step plan may help.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Determine</strong> exactly what collaboration technology your new hybrid workforce will need. Do they mostly hold video conferences with internal staff, or do they do a lot of client-facing video meetings? Will visiting customers use the conference rooms? Do teams often need to share screens, viewing spreadsheets or graphs? Take stock of the collaboration hardware you already have and what you’ll need to purchase to deliver a consistent experience in each room.</li>
 	<li><strong>Inspect</strong> your office to figure out where to put the new collaboration technology and prepare rooms for their new functions. You might need to buy furniture, chairs, and blinds, paint walls, and remove old furnishings that don’t support the new configurations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Buy </strong>off-the-shelf video conferencing and audio equipment for conference rooms and new webcams, headphones, and microphones for workstations. Most companies have already standardized on a platform (such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet) so ensure any hardware you purchase works with your existing collaboration platforms and gives you the flexibility to change platforms at no cost in the future.</li>
 	<li><strong>Install</strong> the new hardware. The quality of off-the-shelf videoconferencing systems has dramatically improved, so you likely won’t need a design consultant or integrator. But if you run into snags, you can always hire an external vendor to help install your new video and audio components.</li>
 	<li><strong>Test</strong> your new setup many times to ensure it’s easy to use, backgrounds and lighting are optimal, and furniture and workstations are set up with a collaboration-first mindset. When your new system meets all your requirements, create a simple user guide for employees before they return to the office.</li>
 	<li><strong>Train</strong> your employees on how to use the technology as it was designed. Leverage the user guide to allow employees to become proficient with the tools and systems that were installed. The best-designed and installed rooms will consistently underperform if your people and teams do not know how to use the systems.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the growth of our <strong>Cultural Sector</strong>. </em>

MGAC’s work in the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/sectors/cultural" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural sector</a> exists as an indisputable answer to the question of why we do what we do. Over the past few decades, we have had the opportunity to set the stage for awe-inspiring performances, house world-class works of art, create monuments to moments in history, and give communities around the world access to meaningful cultural experiences for years to come. This is work that pulls on your heartstrings, inspires and hinges on creativity, and, above all, endures.

In many ways, the seeds of this sector were sown with MGAC’s very first project working on the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-discovery-channel-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Discovery Channel Stores</strong></a>. Part retail shop, part immersive museum experience (down to an egg-shaped elevator, T-Rex skeleton, part of a WWII bomber, and a 270-degree high-definition movie theater), they were dreamt up by a client with a staunch dedication to conservation and education.

Flash-forward 25 years and, today, our cultural sector brings inspiring experiences to life for clients that span public agencies to non-profit associations to for-profit entities and on projects that encompass ground-up construction, renovations, additions, expansions, historic preservation, exhibit fabrication, and art installations for performance facilities, museums, themed entertainment venues, and civic spaces.
<h4><strong>COMMUNITY CORNERSTONES </strong></h4>
Cultural institutions offer local community members access to contemplative, creative, and educational spaces. They represent an opportunity to learn about, connect with, and immerse ourselves in the diverse and dynamic world around us.

One of the most challenging—and rewarding—examples of this was Smithsonian’s <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National Museum of African American History and Culture</strong></a>. MGAC served as the onsite exhibit coordinator for the project, managing and delivering 12 themed exhibits across the museum’s 85,000 SF of exhibit space. At $46M, it was the largest ever exhibit fabrication contract in North America. Our team immediately felt the weight of this legacy project. It was a long-overdue institution with the capacity to move the community, the country, and even the world. That understanding unified the project team and fueled us to deliver on a once-in-a-lifetime, incredibly high-profile project. The museum would go on to be named one of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/metropolis/2016/12/the_eight_best_things_we_built_in_2016_and_why_they_matter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best things America built in 2016</a>.

Beyond accolades, what really inspires our work in this space is the knowledge that a project close-out or ribbon cutting is hardly the end; rather, it’s just the beginning. In North Bethesda, MD, we had the privilege of renovating and growing the 195,000 SF <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/strathmore-music-center/176" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Music Center at Strathmore</strong></a>. As the cultural heart of Montgomery County, the center hosts performances and educational programs that are attended by 125,000 people each year. It’s incredible to consider the cultural influence a single venue like this will have across its lifetime. When we worked on <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/isabel-bader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Queen’s University’s Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts</strong></a> in Kingston, Canada, we knew it too represented so much more than a performance hall. The $63M facility serves as an invaluable teaching, rehearsal, and performance space and a true cultural landmark for the campus and surrounding community. Every detail of the build, every decision that was made, was done to ensure that this opportunity was realized, and we navigated extreme winter weather, large-scale logistical challenges, and a true race to the finish to raise the curtain in time for a new school year. While consulting for a stone façade restoration project at the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-gallery-of-art-east-building-and-pavilion-cafe/172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National Gallery Of Art</strong></a>, we did so knowing it would safely and cost-effectively preserve the building’s legacy. We helped solve extraordinary problems for that custom repair work to be done with minimal disruptions to the museum allowing it to continue to seamlessly serve the nation and invite art lovers to experience the collection of more than 150,000 paintings, sculptures, decorative arts, photographs, prints, and drawings.

In the case of our decade-plus engagement with <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/cbs-news-washington-bureau/72" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CBS News’s</strong></a> <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/cbs-news-washington-bureau/72"><strong>Washington Bureau</strong></a>, from which <em>CBS Evening News,</em> <em>60 Minutes,</em> and<em> Face the Nation </em>are produced, we have helped support CBS’ timeless mission of delivering the nation its news. Reinforced with extensive unseen security measures, the facility is designed to provide primary backup to the CBS’ New York broadcast center.
<h4><strong>PROJECTS OF THE HEART</strong></h4>
Our cultural projects are underscored by a client’s desire to tell a story, share an experience, or engage the community in a meaningful way. These missions are not just about the bottom line; they are about an emotional commitment to the project. In some cases, our work is truly carrying out a client's legacy.

We were honored and humbled by the call to work on the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/9-11-pentagon-memorial-visitor-education-center/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>9/11 Pentagon Memorial Visitor Education Center</strong></a> in Arlington, VA. The memorial was completed in 2008 as a tribute to the 184 individuals who lost their lives during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Now in planning is the Visitor Education Center to compliment the memorial and share this story of our nation’s bravest day with the rest of the country. Through our work on the <a href="https://womensmemorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Military Women’s Memorial</strong></a>, we have had the opportunity to renovate the 30-year-old memorial museum, prepare new exhibits honoring brave women who have served throughout history, and bring new life to the only historical repository documenting all military women’s Armed Forces service in the United States.

In some cases, we have quite literally helped bring a dream to life, carrying a project so far from initial vision through the planning phases and supporting the fundraising efforts. Such was the case when the OSS Society Inc. asked MGAC to serve as Owner’s Representative on the planned $89M <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-museum-of-intelligence-and-special-operations/123" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National Museum of Intelligence and Special Operations</strong></a>. Our team oversaw lease negotiations and execution, procurement and assembly of an exhibit design team, and assisted with the development of fundraising materials and tight-lipped donor meetings.
<h4><strong>AWE-INSPIRING ART INSTALLATIONS</strong></h4>
Over the years, we have been trusted to work on behalf of and beside several working artists with public art commissions. Since 2005, we have worked with internationally acclaimed sculptor <strong>Kendall Buster</strong>, providing project management for the commissioning and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/the-art-of-the-art-installation-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation of large-scale permanent artworks</a> from Tulsa, OK, to Rabat, Morocco.

For our cultural team, no two days look alike, and sometimes this work comes to life in surprising and unexpected forms. Take <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/outflow--brian-tolle/47" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Outflow</strong></a>, a public-artwork-meets-environmental-education-tool, which our project managers helped bring to life for the City of Calgary, Canada. We transformed a segment of the City’s stormwater drainage into an inverted mountain—a massive sculpture designed by artist Brian Tolle—to allow residents to watch how stormwater travels from communities to the natural watershed. We worked on behalf of Tolle for six years, navigating the intricacies and challenges associated with integrating large-scale art into an active public drainage system.

Currently MGAC is working on behalf of Hank Willis Thomas to manage two important public commissioned sculptures in the Boston Common, and at O’Hare International Airport. <em>The Embrace</em> is a new monument planned to honor the legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, in a new type of memorial in the U.S., actually commissioned before the increased debate over public memorials. By highlighting the act of embrace, this memorial shifts the emphasis from singular hero worship to collective action, imploring those curious enough to investigate closer. This monument will call people into the act of empathy, an idea Coretta Scott King captured when she spoke about the power and accessibility of unconditional love. When embraced, this love impels people to go into their community, take risks, and change others' lives for the better.
<h4><strong>GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND</strong></h4>
By their very nature, our cultural projects involve some of MGAC’s most storied challenges. From transplanting massive trees to bringing an Aston Martin through a historic building’s window to its new home in a museum exhibit, this exciting, ever-changing work has a running theme: If there is something inspired or imaginative that needs to get done, we will find a way.

Sometimes the challenges are physical feats, like the time we transplanted a dozen 100,000-pound mature trees with 30-foot root balls as part of landscape design for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/glenstone-the-pavilions/194" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Glenstone</strong></a>, an exhibition from one of the most important private collections of post-World War II artwork, or when we facilitated hanging a 450-foot by 90-foot, $9M stainless steel woven and welded tapestry at the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/dwight-d-eisenhower-memorial/125" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial</strong></a> in Washington, DC. Other times, those challenges take a slightly less tangible form. Our work delivering the new embassy <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/national-property-board-of-sweden-house-of-sweden/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>House of Sweden</strong></a> meant successfully navigating the nuances of a different culture (and a client based across the ocean) while managing the resolution of lingering financial disputes, water penetration issues, and improperly built details. In the end, it proved a rich experience for our team to not only deliver a successful project—and establish an ongoing relationship with the client—but to learn more about the world through another perspective in the process.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC is committed to ESG, as demonstrated by a range of business practices in every office. From broader community engagement to specific office practices, we are constantly asking ourselves how we can minimize our environmental footprint and enhance the communities in which we live and build. Specifically, over the last several months, MGAC has been developing its first ESG Report. The report, scheduled to be published Q1 2022, will enable the company to be more transparent about the risks and opportunities we face.

Our ESG Report will establish a benchmark in key areas that allow us to evaluate and improve our goals year-over-year. It will keep us accountable and visible. MGAC’s ESG Report will also serve as an important communication tool to share with current clients, potential clients, and future and current employees. It makes public our alignment with <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), developed by the United Nations (UN) in 2015. These goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and propel economic growth—all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

MGAC’s commitment to ESG will be affirmed by following the steps outlined below:
<ol>
 	<li>Finalize and publish MGAC’s first annual ESG Report</li>
 	<li>Join UN Global Compact as a signatory and reporting member</li>
 	<li>Certify building performance via Green Globes and Fitwel</li>
 	<li>Move MGAC towards carbon neutrality</li>
</ol>
<h4>Why We Chose These Rating Systems</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>A combination of <a href="http://www.greenglobes.com/home.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Green Globes</strong></a> to monitor and rate building / space physical performance and <a href="https://www.fitwel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fitwel</strong></a> to measure health and wellness factors will allow for differences in attributes of our existing offices, particularly where we have little or no control over the building systems. The two proposed systems require no pre-conditions and allow us to track our own path or focus areas.</li>
 	<li>Documenting these as part of our ESG Report annually will allow us to incorporate justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and sustainability data and strategies. The ESG Report will also give us a benchmark for the following years to track our improvements and provide transparency year-over-year.</li>
 	<li>With our collected data, we can calculate our overall carbon footprint. Using that information, we can buy carbon offsets through <strong><a href="https://carbonfund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://carbonfund.org/</a></strong>. This organization’s Carbon Free Partner Program is an innovative and flexible way to help us calculate, reduce, and offset our carbon footprint by investing in offset environmental projects that align with the interests of the firm.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, everyone. And welcome to MGAC "Inner Voices," a podcast digging into the issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, and the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. As always, I'm gonna preface this podcast by letting you know that we are not experts in all things, diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wanna share our stories and discuss how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the industry and beyond. As you all may know, I'm your podcast host, Bryan Gamez. I'm an Assistant Project Manager here at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today, we have the great honor of speaking with Maxwell Williams, who is up in our San Francisco office. So, Max, do you wanna introduce yourself to our listeners?

Maxwell: Yeah, absolutely. Again, my name is Maxwell Williams. I'm Assistant Project Manager up here in San Francisco. I've been with MGAC seven months now.

Bryan: A fresh new face.

Maxwell: I have been in the construction project management industry for the past four years, spent three years out here in San Francisco, a year or two in Chicago doing program management for manufacturing company. And I am part of the African-American black group of people around the world.

Bryan: Actually, I just didn't know that you were from Chicago, Max. That's really cool. I love Chicago. Well, I'm happy that you're on today. I can't wait to talk about diversity and everything and your perspective on being a black American in the project management construction field. So we've already talked about what your background is. So, Max, we'll just jump into it. So, how has your identity as a black man affected you in the professional spaces? And have you faced any challenges in your career because of your identity?

Maxwell: Everybody definitely has their own set of challenges, and being a black man, I kind of have to preface with a saying that black fathers tell their black children, a black man has to work twice as hard in order to get half the recognition as certain peers. That stems from, you know, 400 years of slavery, 200 years of Jim Crow era up until now, a 100 years of new Jim Crow era. It reinforces that aspect because there are certain perspectives that I am looked at before anybody really knows who I am, where I come from, my comfortability in certain situations. And I really have seen that word of advice that my father has given me throughout my career, my educational journey because I've seen myself having to reach out a lot more, engage a lot more, challenge individuals when I've had a personal, very, very large contributing factor to certain accomplishments that the group has achieved. And it's not, you know, challenging like, oh, you didn't do this, but, hey, what about me?

Bryan: Everyone I've spoken to on this podcast and it does become personal at times. And what I've learned is that every person has these challenges and the general minority group, I feel like, should be really proud of themselves. Everyone in our company really should be proud of themselves because they've really contributed a lot to our industry. And you're saying now that, you know, the challenges we face is because of the societal norms that have been in place for centuries, right. That has created the issue. And right now we have...you're saying you have to work twice as hard, three times as hard just to get to where you wanna be.

Maxwell: Correct. From my perspective, I do believe that these challenges and what the effort of both of our forefathers' things have gotten a lot better for us. And a lot, 1,000 times easier for us compared to their situations. That being said, it was not that long ago and it is still around today so.

Bryan: And that's prevalent in the events that occurred in the past year.

Maxwell: Correct. I mean, the construction industry, architectural industry, contracting industry has a very traditional perspective in terms of how one should carry themselves, what needs to be focused on, how people move forward.

Bryan: And on that, Max, have you ever had to adapt who you are because of what that traditional sense of decorum should be because of what others before us, obviously in the industry have kind of have created, but that's a question I've asked other people, but it seems like here, it's quite relevant.

Maxwell: I've always been in a position of monetary privilege. That has helped really placed me in environments that reflect the corporate world, the industrial world, basically Western civilization.

Bryan: Do you mean like you're saying your socioeconomic status has helped?

Maxwell: Correct. So for, you know, people of color like me, black people coming from the South Side of Chicago, not many of us get to go to private school since we're, you know, the age of three. Not many of us even venture to the North Side of Chicago or Downtown Chicago or have that opportunity to even have friends or connections in different areas, in different neighborhoods, with different cultural influences.

Bryan: Did you grow up in the South Side of Chicago?

Maxwell: I did. Yeah, born and raised. I grew up South Side of Chicago. I was going to school on the North Side. So, you know, I had...

Bryan: You did that commute? That's a long commute, isn't it?

Maxwell: It's a decent commute. And my parents have been in the investment banking industry since the '80s, '90s. And being as intelligent as they are and successful as they are, they've had the capacity to send me to really good schools to get an incredible educational basis. That is not the same for people like me, where I come from whatsoever. That being said, neither is better than the other. I think one helps you maneuver and weave through social-economic structures within our society today.

Bryan: No, I absolutely agree. I think, you know, having the ability to go to a great school, you know, primary, secondary school starting young, that it almost structures how your life may end up, right? Minorities face absolutely more challenges, right? You don't have access to great schools. You need money to go to private school, right? So it's just, it's a systematic issue across the board. Yeah.

Maxwell: And at the same time, all the public schools in the areas are consistently defunded and funds allocated to other things that don't necessarily help improve the general standard of living in that particular zip code or area. As I'm sure you have experienced labels, microaggressions, jokes, baseline senses, and baseline philosophies, and perspective that others may have about your particular ethnic background. Those are challenges in and of itself because we know worlds that are so positive, vibrant, and hopeful where those types of things really diminished the humanity within our own challenges.

Bryan: And ourselves really. I mean, to the bottom line, it's us that it affects. Right? I agree with you. I mean those, yeah, "jokes, comments," you know, that treatment behavior is detrimental to, you know, us as an individual and also to a group. That actually kind of segues into my next question. You know, so with that, what is the greater big picture impact of this treatment and this behavior? Yeah. Beyond just what the jokes are and what these little comments are. I mean, we've already touched upon it.

Maxwell: Right. It is dehumanization. I only use that term because dehumanizing is dangerous and contagious simply due to the fact that we don't all want to be the same, but we all want to be treated the same.

Bryan: No, I know what you mean. Right. But that's interesting. You say dehumanization is contagious. I do think it can be and has been, right? And at the end of the day, we want equality for all, right? I hope that this podcast touches upon all these points and drives these points home to, you know, corporate America and leadership that as we move forward, this treatment and these items still exists. And I hope that in the future, they don't exist. Right. So treatment, if it continues, it'll take a mental toll on an individual and I know, in the pandemic, it's been tough on everyone because we haven't had that face-to-face interaction. So, you know, I think that as we move forward, we have to really use our platforms, our conversations with others to ensure that the treatment or just nasty behavior just doesn't persist. Right?

Maxwell: Absolutely. It just doesn't make sense if we are operating in the fashion that we're operating. There's really only one goal, and that is...well, several goals, three of which being prosperity, respect, and goal achievement. Maybe goal achievement ties into prosperity, but I separate the two because we're all working to a singular mode just as we need as social beings on this earth need to be aware of our carbon footprint that we're putting it on it and destroying the planet on which we live in to give our children and our grandchildren a future, a place to live the way that different perspective deal with each other has to be from a point of respect.

Bryan: Yeah, absolutely. A 100%, I agree with that point. I think that's been the baseline for almost all my conversations with everyone that there's a mutual respect that is sustained throughout, you know, all our careers throughout any of our interactions with other people and other humans. And I think that's what we're all working towards here.

Maxwell: I also want to take that a little further because, with respect, there needs to be the innate human capacity to understand different worlds. And not even understanding different worlds. It's just understanding that somebody has a different perspective from you. Somebody worships or celebrates religion in a different capacity to you. We have different celebrations for different reasons that may not make sense to the other person, but the other person really needs to sit back, listen, and respect wherever they came from instead of projecting their own sense of normality onto...

Bryan: Yeah. Onto that individual with opposing views. Yeah.

Maxwell: That, and processing what the other person is telling you. It's about internalizing how special diversity is, how special somebody from one part of the planet does something on another part of the planet.

Bryan: I 100% agree. You know, I kind of almost told that to my friends as well. You know we don't, I may not understand where someone else's lived experience. Right. But I can do my best to try and understand where they're coming from. To understand that their pain is real. Right? You know, I may not understand what the experience that caused that pain, but I can understand the pain that they're going through. You know, I don't want ever want to project my opinions onto others. Right? And as I speak with my friends, I'm thinking, you know, I respect all the decisions you make. I may not agree with them, but I'm not gonna project my opinions. I just would like to have a conversation with you, you know, to understand our opposing views. And maybe we can meet in the middle. Right.

You know, at the end of the day, humans all experience pain. And Oprah always...oh, I love Oprah. Back when she had her show, she always talked about how...or maybe it was Maya Angelou, but she talked about how all pain is the same, regardless of the experience. And it's our job as human beings to really understand where that individual is coming from. Because at the end of the day, it could happen to you and you're gonna be feeling that exact same pain. And it's our jobs to help each other really. And because when we help each other, that's gonna help everyone prosper. Right? And then, you know, that's in and of itself a little cliche, but I think of it to be true. And, you know, I'm optimistic person. And I hope that in 10 years' time, that's where we're at as a society. In 50 years' time, I hope that it's at a much better place than we're at now. If that makes sense.

Maxwell: Correct. Based on the way I've grown up, my experience, me to look back and see that people like me weren't allowed to drink at the same water fountains as another human being. Does that logically make sense to a knowledgeable individual? It just doesn't really make sense, especially if we're on this mission to thrive together as a species. Which I agree optimistically, I hope everybody's on the same, you know, page, same journey. Some people, you know, some people aren't. And I think that because of the fact that some people aren't, they've really taken things in for themselves and do whatever they can to shape the world around them, to their own perspective mode of operation.

Bryan: Yeah. I do have to say though, on that...I mean, while it's hard to fathom where we were in the 1960s, 1950s, I think that we have come a long way with desegregation. Well, don't get me wrong. A lot of segregated communities in the United States and around the world. I think that we have progressed from an era where it was so highly segregated, and now I hope that as we continue, you know, moving forward as society, that integration of everyone is welcomed and celebrated for everyone's unique diversity.

Maxwell: I completely agree. I feel as if we're kind of at the cusp and a real paradigm turning point, especially with our generation in terms of leading that charge.

Bryan: I would say Millennials and Gen Z are really, I think, driving that home. And you can see that. And especially as corporate America picks up on that, especially because it affects everything from like shopping habits, right? Where we wanna travel to? Where we wanna vacation to? Right. So I think that there...I think people are listening, as they're listening to this podcast, too.

Maxwell: I certainly hope so. I am.

Bryan: So we've basically touched about how diversity in and of itself is so important to our society. You know, you've already...you've touched upon it a little bit, but do you want to describe why it's so important in your opinion?

Maxwell: I mean, if you just look at the course of human history, can you really see why it took us along to get to this point where we are now in terms of trying to work together and be together? One, it just stems from an innate human nature of wanting to be comfortable in your own environment. And when you see that being threatened, we wanna recluse ourselves and do whatever it takes to protect what already is. From my perspective, it's important because as this world grows, as human beings evolve, as we're getting smarter as a species, as we touch different corners of our globe, as we're expanding our reach, we really understand how...we're really learning how similar we actually are. And if we set things up for everybody to be as comfortable as me and you are, amazing things can happen. And people can live life in peace and enjoy what's around them.

Bryan: I agree with that. And that's a common theme of this podcast. I wanna jump to our call to action in our industry. As project managers, you know, we help advise our clients and consult them when we're developing teams, and creating designs plans and, you know, the built environment, you know, what are ways that in the, in our industry, we can impact change through the work we do?

Maxwell: It's showing that work to somebody who may be curious about it. Anybody who may be curious about it? My parents, the house I spent majority of my life in, they build it from the ground up. So while they were off working, my grandfather would pick me up from school and take me to the property, to like, see how everything's going, check on contractors, check on progress, make sure everything's safe. And I really, I got to see how a house was built from the ground up. And it was an incredible experience. The superintendent foreman, Mr. Handy, he set me up with my own little workstation, taking the scrap pieces of wood that he was cutting, a couple of nails, and a hammer. Just don't hurt yourself. I'd be in like a little job site building like wood plains or the benches or something like that, even though it didn't hold up well, or have any structural integrity. There's no limitation...no one group of people are interested in doing one particular thing that we as human being to do, whether it is sports, music, entertainment, biology, chemistry, science, machinery, art, there's no specific group of people who want to do just that.

Bryan: Everyone around the world can be, you know, set their mind to being in any industry. Right. It's not for just one group of people.

Maxwell: Correct. So then as an organization, it's that organization's responsibility to seek out areas where the type of work we do, it may not be prominent in terms of, I guess, marketing or exposure to young formative mind. That being said, I believe that we have a responsibility to show those who don't know what we do, the possibilities. Maybe that's something that they would love to do and continue to do for the rest of their life.

Bryan: And I wanna, you know, pick your brain also, unlike for clients in our industry who are uncomfortable with diversity, what would you tell them? Or what measures can our colleagues take when clients seem uncomfortable with diversity.

Maxwell: I pretty much just ask why?

Bryan: Interesting.

Maxwell: What have their experiences been? You got to analyze the whole thing growing up. Where they've been, what they've been doing, who they've been interacting with.

Bryan: Keep an open mind.

Maxwell: Correct. What their monetary capacity has been in order to do the things that they do. Once you get down to the why and start asking logical questions of, okay, so that's your answer, but does that really make sense to you? Does that make sense to the person sitting next to you?

Bryan: But you're saying you're pushing back on what their norms are. And you're trying to have that conversation. You're opening it up for a conversation. That's what the why question is for. And that's an important question, frankly.

Maxwell: I mean, the reason that we do things really separates the trajectory of our existence. It shapes how well we do it, who we do things within the impact of our actions on other beings who are sharing this space of earth.

Bryan: You see, you talk about, you know, having that conversation with clients, but it's also one of our coworkers who just frankly, may have never experienced that. So if they haven't experienced discrimination or any negative treatment because of their identity, they may be a white man, never experienced that. What advice would you give them to be an ally?

Maxwell: Listen and do research. There is truth in everything. The amount of truth varies. Somebody tells you a blatant lie, you know, it is a blatant lie.

Bryan: Yeah I know it. I think I know what you mean

Maxwell: But In terms of perspective, there is truth. Truth is limited to a norm. Truth is the reality of one situation. And the reality of diverse ethnic group situation is that it hasn't been at the forefront of Western civilization ever, I guess, until now.

Bryan: But you're saying that anyone that does not understand our lived experiences is to...your main advice, piece of advice is to listen and to do their research. And that research could be as simple as having that conversation with the person sitting across the table from you, right. And listening to what their lived experiences are and that's the perspective you're asking them to see, and also respect, of the mutual respect.

Maxwell: Absolutely. Because you're not, I mean, nobody likes being treated poorly. Nobody likes being brushed off. So somebody continues to do that, you're just gonna be labeled a POS and not gonna be...not gonna wanna deal with that. You know, after the question, after I ask why, it's really a game of understanding motivation, whether or not they're really seeded in hatred and self-centeredness or a lack of complete understanding.

Bryan: Interesting, you know, I hope that with this conversation Max, I hope that people who are listening and, you know, gain a little bit of perspective and also motivation and an intention to reach out to others and listen to them, listen to their perspectives, listen to, as I said, their lived experiences and understand that individual at a personal level, not because of their background or their skin color, but because of what they can bring to the table. Right. You know, as we've talked about, this is our diversity and backgrounds should not be a limiting factor. They are assets to the team. So, I'm compelled to say that we've touched upon all those topics of how we can provide a narrative or really provide ways for others to appreciate where we're coming from. And also appreciate all our experiences.

Maxwell: Absolutely, like wholeheartedly.

Bryan: Max, I think that this has been a great conversation. I think we've touched upon a lot of topics here, and I hope that this resonates with people within the industry even far beyond just us and our industry as well. I think that it brings to mind the question of what is our motivation to bridge the gaps between inequity, right? So I really thank you for being a part of this today. It was a pleasure speaking with you, Max, and I think, I hope that all our listeners also gained a little bit of perspective today.

Maxwell: Bryan, thank you for having me. It was an absolute honor and pleasure to be here. I'm here because, you know, I just wanna be heard and I wanna share what I believe a solution can be on a personal level and on an individual level. And I wanna commend you and the team for really stepping up and making sure that this is a priority. Great.

Bryan: Thanks.

Maxwell: Of course.

Bryan: You know, I say that to you. Thank you. Well, with that, everyone, thank you for listening to this episode of MGAC "Inner Voices." I hope you check back next month for our next episode. Thanks, everyone. Bye.]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Environmental sustainability and the energy-intensive construction industry don’t often go hand-in-hand. The construction industry is a massive consumer of raw materials and natural resources and contributes to the world’s carbon emissions. It has many conflicting goals and challenges.

Our industry does not have a mass-produced end-product, each building usually is unique. However, the industry is moving in the right direction as sustainable design is becoming more prevalent based on more stringent building regulations, and products are reviewed and selected not only from a cost perspective, but also based on their sustainable and environmental impact. While knowledge, education, and awareness on sustainability are without a doubt on the increase, one of the biggest challenges centres around the commercial viability and availability of materials.

There is no doubt, for now, that sustainable design does impact initial capital costs. Even though capital costs typically account for only 20% of the lifecycle cost of the building, and sustainable design can reduce operational costs in the long-term, there is still the conflict of available funds at the outset of a project against the savings in the future.

To promote best practices around sustainability, it is our job at MGAC | RLF to not only address the functionality of the building, but to help our clients evaluate their projects based on long-term, not just short-term capital costs. We ensure our clients view the life of the building and the environmental impact it will have.

As the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) kicked-off this week, we sat down with our Glasgow colleagues, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorothyrobertson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorothy Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmclagan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris McLagan</a>, to discuss two projects they are working on with ambitious sustainability goals.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC | RLF:</span> It’s exciting to have the COP26 conference in your hometown of Glasgow this year. Thanks for taking the time to sit down with us. Can you tell us a little bit about the projects you are working on?</strong>

<strong>Dorothy Robertson (DR):</strong> I’ve been working with The University of Strathclyde on the Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC) Phase 2 project. It’s in the early phases, but once complete will consist of two buildings, TIC East which is 20,000 m<sup>2</sup> and TIC West which is 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>. Located in the heart of the Glasgow City Innovation District, the development will be at the centre of the University’s city centre campus, bringing together academia, business, and industry into the one central collaborative space. This partnership in a unique building will work together to find solutions to challenges that matter in areas of economic and environmental importance, including advanced manufacturing and materials; health and well-being; innovation and entrepreneurship; measurement science; enabling technologies; and ocean, air, and space.

<strong>Chris McLagan (CM):</strong> Since November 2018, I’ve been working on the <a href="https://rlf.co.uk/case-studies/national-manufacturing-institute-scotland-nmis-glasgow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS),</a> an unmistakeable building with its distinct heather coloured cladding, and, once complete, will set the standard for the future of manufacturing in Scotland.

The £65M facility is to be an industry-led international centre of manufacturing expertise, led by the Scottish Government in partnership with its enterprise and skills agencies. It will be a national facility for Scotland, where research, industry, and the public sector can work together to transform skills, productivity, and innovation to attract investment and make Scotland a global leader in advanced manufacturing. The new carbon neutral facility, which sits within the Glasgow Airport Investment Area, will include a skills academy, a fully digitalised factory of the future, and a collaboration hub for manufacturers of all sizes and from all sectors.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC | RLF:</span> These sound like exciting projects for the City of Glasgow and Scotland. What is </strong>
<strong>MGAC | RLF’s role on these projects?</strong>

<strong>DR:</strong> For the TIC project, MGAC | RLF provided strategic cost advice from the initial early feasibility stage through to the current design stage, and we are now providing cost consultancy services with the development currently in RIBA Stage 2. We are also providing procurement advice to the University to achieve cost and value for this unique development.

The project is complex in the number of multi-faceted stakeholders from both academia and industry, so ensuring all requirements are met within a budget can be challenging. However, by fully understanding the brief and the key deliverables of the project, we can manage this. The buildings are being developed to Net-Zero and <a href="https://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/">PassivHaus</a> standards, and we understand will become the biggest non-domestic PassivHaus development in the UK.

<strong>CM:</strong> For NMIS, MGAC | RLF is providing cost consultancy services which includes life- and whole-cycle costing, providing price information on material and product choice based on whole life use, rather than initial capital outlay.

The project is seeking a <a href="https://www.breeam.com/">BREEAM</a> Outstanding accreditation. In support of this, MGAC | RLF interfaced with the appointed BREEAM Advisor throughout the pre-contract stages of the project. We assisted and provided information relating to the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA), this being a recent enhancement to the BREEAM accreditation process. A LCA is an assessment used to total up the environmental impact of a product’s supply chain. Product and material choice based on a LCA ensures that the true environmental impact of a material or product is properly considered prior to adoption.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC | RLF:</span> You mentioned Net-Zero, PassivHaus, and BREEAM Outstanding. Can you tell us more about the sustainability aspects of each project?</strong>

<strong>DR:</strong> The TIC project is still in the early stages, but will be designed to PassivHaus Standards, an effective approach for reducing energy demand and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This together with conscientious choice of products with maximum carbon reduction properties will ensure compliance with the University’s Climate Change and Social Responsibility Policy (2016-2026). This policy has four key aims:
<ol>
 	<li>Tackle climate change and reduce resource use;</li>
 	<li>Be socially responsible;</li>
 	<li>Collaborate with others to embed sustainability across the institution; and</li>
 	<li>Share learning and knowledge to help ensure continuous improvement.</li>
</ol>
<strong>CM:</strong> The NMIS building will house a Factory of the Future, which has been designed to be energy carbon neutral in operation. The heat for the building will be sourced from Renfrewshire Council’s ‘ambient heat loop’ system, this producing 90% less carbon emissions than traditional gas boilers. The building will also have EV charging stations available for cars and bikes that are powered by solar energy. To encourage cyclists, paths will be constructed for travel to and around the facility. Landscaping has also been taken into consideration and will be designed to encourage wildlife and biodiversity. As mentioned previously, NMIS is also aspiring for BREEAM Outstanding accreditation, which is the world’s leading sustainability assessment method.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC | RLF:</span> Those are some ambitious sustainability goals that we can’t wait to see through. What do you think these projects mean to the community?</strong>

<strong>DR:</strong> TIC will be located in the heart of Glasgow City Centre, in a regenerated area to be known as Glasgow City Innovation District. The District is home to many innovative companies and organisations who have located here to nurture and accelerate growth, improve productivity, and access world-class research and technology from the University.

Bringing together ambitious, forward-thinking people, the District is tackling societal and global challenges and driving inclusive economic growth. With its world-class skills and talent base, excellent transport links, and reputation as a desirable city to “live, work, and play,” Glasgow is the ideal place to create a thriving community of companies, researchers, and innovation support organisations. These are the key principles of a successful innovation district.

<strong>CM:</strong> The NMIS project is located in Renfrewshire, which is a region of Scotland that was once synonymous with manufacturing, especially car manufacturing, which ceased trading in the early 1980’s. The construction of a facility of this type, that is designed to make Scotland a global leader in advanced manufacturing, almost forty years later, is poignant and is expected to be welcomed by surrounding communities who still hold a strong connection to Scotland’s manufacturing and industrial heritage.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-apan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Analyn Apan</em></strong></a><em>, Vice President of Cost Management at MGAC.</em><strong> </strong>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Analyn! </strong>

<strong>Analyn Apan (AA):</strong> Hi! Thanks for having me.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What is your title, and can you describe your role at MGAC in your own words?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> My title is Vice President of Cost Management. Working in cost management, in many ways, my role is serving as a trusted advisor to a client. They have a project or a development they need to execute, and they seek our advice on the best way to do it. We’ll assess a budget for them and help set up the project. Once it’s set up, we’ll advise on how to manage it and how to properly allocate the cost of the project. A lot of times, if we’re working with architects, we’ll do some milestone cost estimates, so that at every stage of the design, we validate the project.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And, how long have you been with the firm?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I’ve been with MGAC—in the Los Angeles office—eight years now.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You were one of the founding employees of our LA office, correct? Can you share a bit about how that came to be?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> That’s right; I was part of the five people who started MGAC in LA. We used to work with a firm called Davis Langdon who was acquired by AECOM. Five of us ended leaving AECOM and starting a different firm who was eventually acquired by MGAC to start the LA office. That’s how it all started! Most of us are still here today.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool! So, was this line of work always in the cards for you? What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> There was actually only one job that I wanted to be: an engineer. I grew up in the Philippines and had an engineer role model in my family. As I got older, my skills matched, and I graduated as a structural and civil engineer. But soon after, there was a construction downturn in the Philippines, and I moved over to a Quantity Surveyor (QS) role. It involves contracts, quantity surveying, and cost management, as compared to engineering’s more technical focus on design and construction. I immediately loved QS because instead of just focusing on one aspect of a building, I was able to look at every aspect, from rebar to finishes. I could help analyze it and put it all together. This was back in the early ‘90s. I was with Davis Langdon, which was just starting a practice in the Philippines; they were a pioneer of the QS practice there. So, I managed the first QS projects in the Philippines.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool! So how and when did you move to the Los Angeles area?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> About 20 years ago, I decided to join my family in the States—I’m one of three kids, and my siblings were already here. During the time I was considering this move, my boss told me that Davis Langdon was planning to open an office in the U.S. He asked if I wanted to be a part of it. I said, “Of course!” So that’s how it started.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow, so you really took a leap of faith. </strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> It did. I was fortunate that my work paved the way for me to work here. When you’re from another country, it can be really hard to find a job in the States—especially the same level of job you might have in your home country.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Safe to say you’ve had an incredible career since coming to the States, especially during your years with MGAC. What keeps you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I'm working on three hospital projects right now, and I’m managing multiple other projects in LA in performing arts and higher education. I also train and mentor new hires on the cost management team. It’s something I’ve been doing for a long time now, and I really have a passion for it.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s a great way to leave an impact on the firm.</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I hope so. You learn so much from experience in this line of work. Younger people don’t have that experience yet. So as a team leader, you can either keep your knowledge to yourself, or share it with them. I think it’s important to pass it on. It can really make a difference, and it’s a way to set a plan for success for not only that individual, but the whole team.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Do you feel there are any misconceptions about the work your team does?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I think it’s easy for people to think what we do is boring. But I think it’s anything but boring! Our jobs start without any design. It’s just a plan, a program. And you need to put together a cost for that program. For example, take a 300-room hotel. You need to put together a cost for that, being as accurate as possible, without any other knowledge. Later, you’ll need to validate it. Eventually, the design will evolve, but you need to maintain the cost. Some people describe us as operating in the background, but budget can make or break a project. In many ways, it all depends on cost.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So true. Operating with such limited knowledge might be a challenge for some, though it’s safe to say you’re comfortable taking on those challenges. Are there any, in particular, that come to mind?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> It’s true that I’m more of a technical person, and I “speak the language” of cost and project controls well. But sometimes, it’s hard for me to verbalize my ideas, as English is not my first language. I feel the need to really prove I have the knowledge, the ideas, the skills. But then I remind myself that I absolutely can do these things! At MGAC, I’ve worked on so many major projects, billion-dollar work. I find it’s important to look back and remember that in moments of doubt.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! Speaking of the company, what at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> It means so much that my supervisors have believed in me. They’ve given me the opportunity to work on challenging, high-profile projects. They’re certainly not stopping me from proving myself and moving upward.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> It's rewarding to see projects you’ve worked so diligently on being built. Many of those I've been a part of have been government projects and managing them comes with a big responsibility. After all, you’re spending the public’s money! We’re like the auditor ensuring money is being spent on what’s truly needed, and nothing unnecessary. We are scrutinizing, analyzing, and ultimately validating the contractor’s costs. We’re like the client’s second set of eyes.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> Truly, my job! I love it. I’ve been doing this work for so many years, but I'm still excited every time I start a new project. It’s almost like an art piece for me. When I start setting things up, I can see the end product. I see how it should be presented, and I feel pride in what I’m putting together. Some people think it’s just numbers in a report. But for me, it’s a story.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> Driving. I live 30 miles from the office! Leaving work and driving home gives me time to reassess what I've done for the day and conceptualize what comes next. That’s where my ideas come from.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow, that must be quite the drive in LA traffic!</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> It usually takes me a couple of hours. But that’s my way of making my brain work for ideas.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I need to start each morning with a coffee. From there, I have a routine at home—reading the Bible, exercising, and then starting my drive. Once I get to the office, more coffee!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> There are too many! But the first that comes to mind is the Bible.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I hope my colleagues remember that I always delivered for our clients. I pride myself on ensuring each of our clients feels prioritized every step of the way. Because I work on multiple projects at once, I am almost always starting a new one before finishing another. You must master running them in parallel: asking questions, always communicating. Making them feel prioritized is an important aspect of this work.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How about a few rapid-fire questions?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> That sounds good!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in five words or less.</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> Interesting. Exciting. Important.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I'm always the first one in the office, so I turn on the lights! I sit down and start working right away. As people start to come in, I'll say hi to them.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> The last thing?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I clean off my desk and take care of my dirty dishes.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I have a toothbrush, so I can brush my teeth after lunch. I always get comments on it!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> A salad—I always bring it from home.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> Messages and weather.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It’s hard to believe that 2021 is coming to a close! What’s your biggest work goal to wrap before the year’s end?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I’ve been working on a benchmark tool that compiles all of our historical project data and can be used to compare / analyze new projects. I want to see it up and running, with people using it this year.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

<strong>AA:</strong> I hope to be spearheading even deeper collaboration between cost management and MGAC’s various services. We work very well together now, but I know there are always opportunities for more integration. For example, the benchmark tool I’m putting together can truly benefit everyone, across services. For me, that’s exciting!

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Beth: Hi, and welcome to MGAC's "Inner Voices." It's a podcast where we're digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. I'm Beth Scully, coming to you from sunny...yes, sunny Seattle today. I'm a senior project manager. As a disclaimer, before we begin our podcast, I wanna begin by saying that we are, by no means, saying that we're subject matter experts in all things of diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a cisgender woman, I can speak to my lived experience and do my best to help our guests share their experiences as well. But our hope is that by sharing our stories together, we create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond.

Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Jacqualynn Karsten. Jacqualynn is a senior construction manager at MGAC and will be representing a woman's perspective in that community. Jacqualynn's had a long career in the AEC industry and has deep respect from everyone who knows her and works with her. She is a subject matter expert and a leader. So, hi, Jacqualynn.

Jacqualynn: Thank you for that intro.

Beth: I know your story because we've chatted prior. But can you please share with our listeners a little bit about yourself, your position, your location, how long you've been at MGAC? And let's get to it and get into your professional background.

Jacqualynn: Sure. I started with MGAC about two and a half years ago. I came on board to work on the T-Mobile headquarters renovation project. I've been here the entire time full-time. And prior to that, I've worked on the construction side of the industry, worked on the furniture and design a little bit and the owner's side as well. So, I've been in the industry now just over 23 years.

Beth: So, you didn't start out to be a construction manager. Where did you start, Jacqualynn?

Jacqualynn: I started by accident working for a friend of mine's company, adding some additional resources for them to help with some campus move projects that they were doing. That was my first introduction. I met some great clients, and they kind of recruited me over time into the owner side working on their construction projects. And from there, I just took off and went down a very exciting path by no design of myself. They were just opportunities that kind of came my way, and went for them because good people believed in me.

Beth: So, you really dug in, and you are self-taught. Yes?

Jacqualynn: Yeah. I'm mostly self-taught. I did go through design school, but I've not necessarily directly applied that in any of the positions I've had. It certainly helped me gain perspective but was just not a specialty that I once kind of gone through the program decided that it wasn't something that I was as passionate about as I had been at the onset of the program.

Beth: You spoke a little bit about working with a superintendent that really helped you dig in and get deep in your learning.

Jacqualynn: I would say the best experiences and knowledge I've gained over time has been really engaging with the superintendents I've had on my projects, both on the owner side and when I worked on the general contractor side. They have such a tremendous depth of experience. And I find them to be the best teachers. Once you demonstrate to them that you're truly interested and you're wanting to learn and get better and do more, they're very excited and willing to help educate. And for me, learning kind of in the field and learning from the ground-up on the constructability side was the most exciting for me and where I really kind of became a sponge and where I took to it the most as far as learning.

Beth: As you were doing this, I know you to be a heads-down kind of gal, you really dig in. You were learning everything that you can. Were you cognizant of the fact that you were carving a path as a woman in a construction industry?

Jacqualynn: I wasn't. I was very intimidated. I worked with superintendents that had, at that time, 20-plus years experience, and it was hard for me to engage with them. It was hard for me to kind of be vulnerable and show them the depths of what I didn't know, but that I wanted to know. And I was so focused that it wasn't until many years later or experiences later where I started recognizing, "I'm really the only woman in the room or I'm really the only woman on this project. I'm really the only woman on the whole project team," that I started to kind of look outward and go, "Why is that? Why aren't there more of us? What's keeping more diversity of all types coming into working on construction projects?" I think they're very exciting. I have a lot of fun with them. There's tremendous variety. And it's endless learning for those that always wanna work on getting better. You never hit a point where you know it all, where you have nothing left to learn or experience. And to me, that's very exciting.

Beth: Yeah, I would say it is a constant learning curve, a constant challenge. But we touched on imposter syndrome for a moment. And for our listeners, I just want to read a definition of what imposter syndrome is described as. Imposter syndrome refers to the belief that one is incompetent in their field, that others have more knowledge or skills than they do in a certain area, or that their accomplishments are due to luck, chance, or even their appearance, and has little to do with their own efforts or hard work. These individuals are typically high achievers and feel this way despite having previous experiences of success, and are unable to internalize their accomplishments causing feelings of persistent self-doubt. That's a long-winded definition, but I wanted to set the stage and level set for our listeners about imposter syndrome. And curiously, as you look at the statistics for this, women suffer from this at 85%. Where this came up in our conversation, Jacqualynn, was where you were at Turner, you didn't know things. I wanna explore with you as a woman how, in retrospect, you may have gone through imposter syndrome.

Jacqualynn: As I mentioned a little earlier, it was intimidating when I first came onto the construction side. I knew enough. I knew the process. I didn't know the intricacies. And I certainly didn't understand on the construction side the depth of risk that goes along with the work from a financial standpoint, from a safety standpoint, from a relation standpoint. So, I once introduced to it was deeply heads down for a long time and worked tirelessly. I worked out of fear. I didn't work out of passion. It was something I was passionate about, but it was terrifying to think about learning all of the things that go with risk management and all the things that go with building your relationships while keeping risk management at the forefront. In retrospect, I feel like I worked harder and longer for many years to, not just grasp that, but to demonstrate that I was trusting from the client's perspective, knowledgeable and trusting from the subcontractor and our own internal team's perspective and from the rest of the project team.

In some ways, it's very empowering to be new to the group, to be recognized as someone that doesn't know something, and people take that into consideration. But it's also intimidating because you don't want to be the one that affects the team in any negative way for slowing a process down or for making a bad decision. So, it was something I thought of all the time. I was very calculated in every response I put forth and every conversation I had. It took me a lot longer in the preparation end of things to get to the point of delivering that information. I did it partly because I had a lot to learn, but I also did it because of the tremendous amount of respect I had for the people around me at the table. And I wanted that respect. It was something that was very important to me.

Beth: Hindsight's 2020, what advice would you give on how to encourage women just beginning their careers to avoid the pitfall of imposter syndrome?

Jacqualynn: I would say a couple of things. I would say try your best to be your authentic self and understand the power that is there by raising your hand and saying, "I don't know. Can you help me?" Don't be afraid to raise your hand. It's the best thing you can do for your team, to raise your hand and say you don't know, but you wanna know, versus pretending you know and hoping you know and shutting the door and kind of walking away and just hoping things work out. There's no shortcuts in learning how to build. There's no shortcuts in learning how to build great relationships with your clients and great relationships with your project team. And to me, there's so many different types of people. And we don't always all work together as well as we'd like, but we always wanna help each other and are far more willing to do so with somebody that is authentic and willing to admit what they don't know, but that they wanna learn. I've never been on a project...I've never worked with a project team that doesn't want to help everybody on the team be successful. That's the beauty of our industry, too, is even when you're busy, even when you've got too much work on your plate, you still want your team to be successful. It's like a team sport. It's not an individual sport. And as you work as an individual, you will be less successful than is if you work as a team.

Beth: Yeah. I think it's important, you know, those of us who have had a longer runway to our careers, you look back, and you truly can say that some of your failures were the deepest learning that you had and it was okay. Right? It was okay.

Jacqualynn: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Beth: So, as you look at the breadth of your career, Jacqualynn, looking back, you mentioned earlier that you were so heads-down, that you didn't notice you were the only woman in the room necessarily. You were the sponge absorbing things. But as you look back, can you see ways or places that being a woman affected you in professional spaces, or identify any challenges that you faced in your career?

Jacqualynn: Certainly. I, to an extent, put up my own barriers, perceived barriers, I suppose. And in looking back, I took what I felt as perceived barriers and kind of instilled them on staff. As I started taking on staff and coaching and mentoring some of the younger project engineers coming into the organization, I admittedly was harder on some of them than others because I wanted them to succeed better. Over time, I've learned that it was important for everybody to be equally successful. That was something that took me a while to get through and recognize, "I don't need to be harder on somebody. I need to empower them, not be harder on them. I don't wanna make it more difficult. I wanna make them more excited."

We've talked about the heads-down theory. In retrospect, that was a style that benefited me as hard as it was at the time. It's a style for me that has worked. And I enjoy now when I'm working on something to be heads-down and to get completely immersed in it. That's fun for me. But that's not something at the time that was learned. It took me also a significant amount of time to get through that and go, "Oh, yeah, I can have fun with this." A lot of people joke with me like, "Why don't you leave early, or, you know, why do you put those hours in?" Work is fun for me. Lots of other things are fun for me, but there is great excitement and passion in learning more about our industry. And it's fun. It's also really fun to work with the team and see people collaborate and make solutions happen. And it's a lot of fun to see people learn things as well. And it's probably the greatest reward that I have at this point in my career is seeing people have fun learning.

Beth: As you look back, though, could you identify any specific challenges that you faced as a woman in a male-dominated industry?
Jacqualynn: Well, certainly, I did have the opportunity to work in other areas of the country on some projects. And I would say the Pacific Northwest is the most progressive and the most inclusive. At the time, when I worked here locally, I didn't think other areas of the country would be different. But when I did go to work in another area of the country, I was shocked to see such blatant discrimination for women. And it caught me off guard. It was hurtful or disrespectful, I guess. I didn't know how to react to it. I think, in hindsight, I did the right thing. I'm not sure I would have done things differently, but there were a few blatant encounters where I wouldn't have expected it specifically during the construction of a project.

The most memorable experience for me was, I was working on a project in the South, was getting ready to do a progress walk with our clients, and I just did a quick walkthrough prior to their arrival. And some of the crews have their job boxes out, and in there, they had some compromising, inappropriate calendars that would be offensive to most women, I would think. I didn't quite know what to do with it. I asked them to take them down. They refused. And it was not the response I expected. And at the moment, I was like, "I don't know what to say next. I don't know what to do next." I ended up reaching out to my superior and their superior to get the item resolved. But I'll never forget the nervousness I had in approaching them. And I'll never forget the response they initially gave me, which was, "No, I'm not gonna do that." And I'll also never forget the feeling I had later on of empowering myself to use my voice. And in the moment, I was nervous, and in the moment, I was offended, but after that moment, I found great power and fearlessness of, "I could do this again. What's the worst that could happen?"

And I used that voice in many different ways, whether it was asking questions, whether it was telling somebody to make sure they had on their safety gear, or to make sure that they were putting something away, and they weren't leaving a mess that would cause a safety hazard. The more you use your voice, for me, the easier it is to use my voice. As I get older, I'm more comfortable using my voice, and I know my voice is heard. And that is very rewarding and very empowering and inspiring to continue to learn and apply it as necessary.

Beth: It's a powerful story, Jacqualynn. Thank you for sharing it, I think especially for women as they're beginning their careers to identify that you had fear, and yet you walk through it, and you used your voice. And every time you use that voice, you know, you feel strengthened and empowered. It's a real gift that you have. So, you're a manager. And I'm wondering if you will speak to the power of having a diverse bench as your team and how it strengthens an organization to have a diverse bench.

Jacqualynn: Absolutely. I think many times we get into a pattern that becomes comfortable. And bringing outsiders in or bringing new perspectives in can be beneficial, but it also can be time-consuming. And it is not always easy to make your first step as stepping back and bringing somebody new into the mix. But time after time, I've seen the value of when you have different types of people at the table or in a meeting in the field with your client. There's a better outcome. There's a better understanding. There's a better perspective that comes out of that. Different people bring different skill sets and perspectives into any conversation. And I've enjoyed making the time to hear those. It's a different way of learning about a project, but it is applicable to the project and beyond. And I so much enjoy talking with the different team members and the whole project team about what's important to them and what they bring to the table. What I find most beneficial about the tough lessons learned is how you use them going forward. And it's very similar to me when you work with different types of people, what perspectives they bring, and how easy it is if you just give them a chance to contribute how you can apply those to future conditions and circumstances as well.

Beth: So, what would a more diverse AEC industry look like to you?

Jacqualynn: Certainly, there's a higher population of women in the industry now. Certainly, there could be more. But I don't see different ethnic backgrounds as much as I would like. I've worked on certain projects where everybody is white, and that's not the way our culture is. So, how can a group of white people build a space for diverse people? We need all people, all types of backgrounds able and encouraged to come into this industry and bring their contributions.

Beth: So, in 10 years time, what do you want it to look like?

Jacqualynn: I think it looks like a box of crayons.

Beth: Yeah. I love it.

Jacqualynn: I don't want it to look like a rainbow. I want it to be bigger than that. I want every color and every type of background of somebody's culture to be celebrated. And I have a lot more to learn about the various cultures within our own organization and our clients' organizations, and I need them personally to be at the table to help me learn and apply it. I don't want to build a space for one type of person. I wanna be part of a project team that provides beautiful, usable space for a diverse background of people. And we can't do that without a diverse team. The more we can get representation from the box of crayons, the better. And to me, 10 years isn't an end game, to me, it's just a progress point. And I'd like to see it go further than that. I think the more equal representation you have of every walk of life, the better success we will all have.

Beth: Imagine someone comes to you and says, "I believe in you, Jacqualynn. I want you to build a company from the ground up." What do you do to ensure that diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to a company's values? How do you bake that in?

Jacqualynn: I think you walk the walk. I think in every aspect of building the business, you bring diverse people into the conversation from the funding standpoint, from the leasing standpoint, from the client standpoint. You immerse yourself in it, and that becomes part of who you are. And if that is part of your foundation, I think it's easier to carry it forward. It's harder for other organizations to make that a new goal of theirs because they have to unlearn different behaviors and different practices in order to learn better practices and new behaviors. But I think it would start from kind of the nucleus of starting a company is you can't not look at every aspect of all points of the business as being diverse and inclusive as possible. Honestly, I wouldn't know how to do it. I would need to rely on experts that would help kind of guide us along the way. But I couldn't not do it. I couldn't not bring people in that are subject matter experts in that field to help educate myself and the rest of the team to help build the foundation of that business appropriately.

Beth: For others and for even our co-workers who may not have had personal experience with discrimination or the negative treatment of women, what advice would you give on how to be an ally?

Jacqualynn: I think the easy answer is listen to your team, but that is not easy to do. As a society, I think we always pretend we're listening, but we're also preparing our response to whatever that person is saying. So, you're hearing maybe 30-40% of what they're saying. I think full immersion into what those experiences are, I think they need to walk in other people's shoes. They need to be part of a minority group. They need to be discriminated against to feel that. They need to be put in those situations. For me, that was telling. And I try to apply that when I look at what some of other cultures and ethnic groups are experiencing currently and try to put myself in their shoes. It takes time, and you have to wanna do it.

I think the team that we work with now that's not felt discrimination in a traditional sense or in a non-traditional sense would be willing to do that. I think the part of our team that is like that has to be introduced to it and has to really listen and invest in those experiences and the conversations of their team that has gone through it to really take it in. That's what works for me. I've seen how it works for others. It doesn't work for everyone. It only works if you open your mind to it and you really wanna learn. So, if you run into a group that says they wanna do it, but they're not necessarily getting what you think they need to get out of it, talk to them about what's keeping them from opening up about it. Is it fear? Is it time? Is it distractions? There could be an easier answer to it. There might not be an answer to it at all, and they may not be the right people to go through that experience and learn because it's not always easy to get there. So, it's an investment to help get them there, but it's an important one to make.

Beth: So, as we're nearing the conclusion of our conversation, Jacqualynn, I'm wondering, have we left anything out about the important topic of women as it relates to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or thoughts coming to mind that, you know, you might have that moment of saying, "Gosh, I listened to this interview, I wish I would have said"? We can take the space and the time for you to reflect again and just offer that to you about women in this industry.

Jacqualynn: I think women, in general, bring strengths that aren't organically in our industry, universally speaking. I think women, in general, are great multitaskers. I think they're very organized. I think they are innately empathetic, whether they're a parent or not, they've had certain experiences, and they've had the struggles of juggling, and they bring a level of patience to a project team that I've experienced, and I've really enjoyed. And as a result, I've looked at that within myself and gone, "How can I be better at this? And how can I celebrate it and add value?" This industry is losing great talent as folks come upon retirement age, and people coming into the industry, the percentages are far less. So, we don't have the resource pool that we had 12, 15 years ago.

We have to find new ways to keep people in this industry. And I think having women at the table contributes to that in many ways because they have experienced some of the struggles of juggling multiple things and having to make tough decisions. And whether or not they're the ones making the tough decisions on a project, they understand what making tough decisions looks like. So, to me, those are paramount in keeping this industry afloat going forward. But it takes all people. As a woman, I enjoy seeing more women at the table, and I'm proud when I see them able to contribute and bring things to the conversation that make a difference, because it's proof, it's proof to the team that they made the right decision by having these people at the table.

Beth: Thank you, Jacqualynn. Well, I can tell our listeners that I have the privilege to serve on Jacqualynn's team, and she is an ass-kicker and the real deal. I wanna take this opportunity to just thank you, Jacqualynn, for sharing your story, for your candor, for your openness.

Jacqualynn: Thank you, Beth. Thank you for inviting me to this. It's really afforded me the ability to reflect on some of the experiences I've had, and it has kind of reinvigorated me in how I work with people and different types of people and practicing what I wanna see, and engaging and empowering the best out of all the people on the team and wanting more different types of people on the team. So, thank you for that.

Beth: You're welcome. Again, thank you. That concludes this podcast of "MGAC Inner Voices." Thank you so much for joining us. And please, check back next month for another episode of "Inner Voices." Until then, take care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real. Today, join us as we revisit the evolution of our Cost Management and Project Controls work.</em>

A successful project boils down to three things: time, cost, and quality. Today, MGAC’s <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/project-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cost Management</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/project-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Project Controls</strong></a> arm plays a crucial role in ensuring these items are accomplished on all our projects. MGAC’s work in this space began in earnest in 2013. In a strategic move to bring these increasingly critical services under our roof, MGAC acquired a cost consultancy group in the Los Angeles area. The small firm was started by several individuals who struck out on their own after working together at the consultancy company Davis Langdon. The acquisition opened the doors to MGAC’s Los Angeles office, and the founding team hit the ground running.

What began as traditional cost consultancy work has since evolved to comprise not only cost estimating  but also scheduling, claims analysis, risk management, bid negotiation, contract procurement, change order management, reporting and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/project-controls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>more</strong></a>—all under the umbrella of Project Controls. This team works from feasibility and programming through detailed design, construction, and close-out, serving as unbiased consultants to allow informed independent decisions at every step. At any given time, the Cost Management and Project Controls group is working on three-quarters of the firm’s projects across a wide range of sectors. Embodying detailed diligence, they are the bedrock of so much of our firm's work, and their ability to take on anything that comes their way makes it all happen.
<h4><strong>GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS</strong></h4>
Some of MGAC’s most complex and ambitious projects over the years have unfolded in the corporate and commercial space, and our Cost Management and Project Controls team has been instrumental in bringing those buildings across the finish line.

In 2014, MGAC was retained to deliver a new headquarters for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-greetings-headquarters/190" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>American Greetings</strong></a>. The new Westlake, OH, build was sizable—to the tune of 660,000 SF. MGAC was asked to step in after the project’s first project manager had been terminated. The cost team went to work straight away, reevaluating and ultimately challenging prior assumptions relating to the contractor procurement. It paid off, and upon the advice of our team, contracting was awarded at $22M less than the original construction team’s proposal.

In 2016, another headquarters relocation, this time for the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/urban-institute-headquarters/77"><strong>Urban </strong></a><a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/urban-institute-headquarters/77" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Institute</strong></a>. The job entailed significant cost work. MGAC worked with the Institute to negotiate lease commencement terms for the new 140,000 SF office. The process was rigorous and involved massive opposition from the real estate brokers. But we stood our ground on behalf of the client—our dogged approach paid off. The strict definition of building completion that our team wrote and included in the final lease document saved them roughly $3M in rent costs.

One of the team’s first commercial mixed-use projects came early on with the redevelopment of the<strong> Century Plaza Hotel</strong>, a 17-story historic landmark in Los Angeles County’s Century City, together with two 45 story towers housing luxury condominiums, all totaling about 2 million GSF. The project was complex, with multiple funding sources at play, separate loans, five GMP packages, multiple bid packages, and a fast-track schedule for design and negotiation of trade contracts. MGAC’s multi-year involvement began with design stage cost estimating and negotiation of the GMP with the general contractor. Ongoing work has entailed independent cost reviews, evaluations, and recommendations on the settlement of numerous change orders across multiple trades on behalf of the client. Successfully navigating the nuances of this project helped build a reputation for MGAC’s unparalleled cost services in the mixed-use and commercial space, leading to new work in the San Francisco area—and ultimately prompting the founding of a new office for MGAC.

Fast forward to today, and our team is bringing major projects across the finish line for corporate and commercial brands such as <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?keywords=hilton" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hilton</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?keywords=t-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>T-Mobile</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/nfl-media-headquarters/223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NFL Media</strong></a><strong>, Freddie Mac, </strong>and<strong> Sherwin-Williams</strong>, to name a few.
<h4><strong>DELIVERING HIGH-PROFILE PROJECTS</strong></h4>
Some of the most visible projects embedded in communities—schools and civic spaces—often operate within strict budget constraints and under the public eye. Every dollar matters and must be accounted for, always. Over the years, our team has worked on countless projects in this realm, dictating scope from the bottom line, exploring the most cost-effective design alternatives, and providing all-important, up-to-date estimates along the way.

In the education sector, we have worked coast-to-coast in both K-12 schools and at the university level. In 2017, MGAC was awarded an IDIQ by the DC Department of General Services (DGS) to help <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?keywords=dc+public+schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DC Public Schools</strong></a> with their ongoing work to renovate over 100 educational facilities in the Washington, DC area. Over the past few years, MGAC has been involved with eight school modernization projects with a total CIP value of approximately $450M. Each campus comes with unique challenges, and the job has brought our team tasks that range from renovating a nationally recognized historic site to breaking ground on DC’s first net-zero energy school. No matter the ask, our cost team’s continued efforts have ensured lower construction costs per every square foot touched.

On the higher-education side, we have worked with high-profile colleges and universities on new builds and renovations. At the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/university-of-california-san-diego/59" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>University of California, San Diego</strong></a>, we have completed a variety of cost estimating and value engineering projects on areas of the campus ranging from classrooms to cafés, auditoriums to laboratories, and everything in between. Within just one research space, we saved the university $15M by offering cost support throughout the design phase. At <strong>Prince George’s Community College</strong> in Maryland, MGAC was engaged to develop a cost model based on program documents and concept sketches. The College was looking to undergo a large renovation and expansion, and our cost model determined that the budget was $16M short of the client’s programmatic and qualitative expectations. An additional $10M was added to the budget, and our value-engineering efforts bridged the gap. Currently, the team is hard at work in Baltimore and Washington, DC, supporting <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/johns-hopkins-university/222" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong></a> on more than a dozen projects with budget and schedule maintenance, cost tracking, scheduling, design management, risk assessment, and daily on-site construction oversight and reporting.

On the civics side of things, the team has partnered with the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/judicial-council-of-california-modesto-courthouse/216" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Judicial Council of California</strong></a> on new-build courthouses providing cost estimates, cost comparisons, feasibility studies, value engineering, and budget reconciliation and analysis, on approximately 10 new State Courthouses. MGAC helped open the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/long-beach-civic-center/39" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Long Beach Civic Center</strong></a>, a new 22-acre mixed-use district, in 2019 by providing capital budgets development, capital cost and lifecycle cost analysis, and risk and contingency management.
<h4><strong>AN ART, AND A SCIENCE </strong></h4>
As a company, MGAC has built a reputation for tackling exceptionally challenging and uniquely ambitious projects. Sometimes those challenges come from scale, from first-of-its-kind builds, or from high-stakes and highly customized features. Two sectors that often borrow on that last piece are cultural work and healthcare facilities. Both of these industries build with uncompromisable requirements and a need to evolve over time. Taking on these kinds of projects is fittingly—and quite literally—both an art and a science.

Just outside of Washington, DC in Potomac, MD, on a 230-acre property, sits <strong>Glenstone</strong>, a contemporary art museum boasting a collection of more than 1,300 works. MGAC was first introduced to Glenstone to conduct a cost study of the existing museum space, which was completed in 2006. That study, and the cost-savings we identified, paved the way for new projects—namely <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/glenstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Pavilions</strong></a>. The plan for The Pavilions was an ambitious one. The expansion would quadruple exhibit space and offer free, up-close access to world-class art, stunning structures, and sweeping landscapes. No detail on the architecture and building front was too small; each of the 26,000 concrete blocks was hand-poured, the windows were painstakingly studied and engineered, and the 18,000 SF water court at the center is fed by rainwater harvested from the museum’s rooftops. Ultimately, the entire space needed to honor and safely house each work of art. MGAC’s Cost Management team was engaged throughout the entire process to bring to life the striking and stirring exhibition space that welcomes nearly 100,000 visitors each year.

The healthcare sector likewise brings work as challenging as it is rewarding. As with cultural spaces, healthcare buildings need to combine form with function and stand the test of time. Aligning cost, scope, and quality is non-negotiable. Over the years, MGAC’s cost team has successfully navigated many complex healthcare builds—projects with large capital investments, diverse stakeholder interests, serious technology demands, and a multitude of risks to be assessed. Members of our team have been providing Cost Management services to<strong> Cedars-Sinai</strong> for the last 20 years for multiple inpatient and outpatient facilities. We have worked with <strong>Scripps Health</strong> on multiple projects to provide benchmarking, program cost modeling, concept and full design cost estimating, and total cost management services on new builds. Currently, we are providing cost planning for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/antelope-valley-hospital-replacement-hospital/247" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Antelope Valley Hospital’s</strong></a> new, 230-bed, 356,000 SF hospital in Lancaster, California, and we are just starting up on a new $900M inpatient tower for Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

Healthcare projects like these keep our team on their toes. Every project in this space is unique, and our database of national healthcare costs provides extensive benchmark data that can be adjusted for time and location to specific project criteria. This allows us to meet the needs of every one of our clients for projects of all scales, from new-build patient towers to program-specific interior renovations. As patient care evolves and as technology advances, so too does our approach to the work.
<h4><strong>SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS ACROSS SECTORS </strong></h4>
Our cost and project controls team has worked across every sector MGAC touches, and our portfolio includes work on the most high-profile and complex building projects in the world. To each, we have brought deep expertise and customized solutions to every stage of development.

In our work, the only constant is change, and our team’s diverse experience and expertise keep us nimble, always. Over the years, we have seen—and met—every possible circumstance, every kind of challenge. Every day, more arise. The way buildings are built is changing. preconstruction looks dramatically different than it did just five years ago. Sustainability is at the forefront of new builds. Technology has moved to center stage. All these things affect cost and staying on top of these changes is what our team does best.

As a single-point-solution, we take great pride in digging into each project that comes through the door—making our clients’ goals our own, sweating the small stuff, and analyzing and measuring against every possible outcome along the way. We know that for our clients, cost doesn’t just boil down to construction expenses. There are other professional costs, permits, taxes, insurance payments, and so much more to consider the Total Project Budget. We make it our business to understand every part of our client’s business. Our foundational approach to this work is holistic by nature and extends far beyond merely managing scope and budgets. We are our clients’ eyes and ears on the ground and, when it comes down to it, we will do whatever it takes to keep complex builds on track and ensure successful project delivery. Over the years, we have done it time and time again. And with a full plate and exciting opportunities on the horizon, we know we are just getting started.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em><em> </em>

<em>Today, we get to know </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-lemcke-28b147146/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lauren Lemcke</em></a><em>, Project Surveyor at MGAC | RLF.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Lauren! Let’s start off with you sharing a bit about your role. </strong>

<strong>Lauren Lemcke (LL):</strong> Thanks for having me! I’m a project surveyor in MGAC | RLF’s Brighton office in the UK. My role predominantly involves working as a quantity surveyor, but I also work as a contract administrator, and an employer’s agent.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Nice. And for those who aren’t familiar, that’s more on the cost management side of things?</strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>That’s right. It’s quite varied, but predominantly on the cost side. We produce estimates for clients to help them understand the costs of their development, assist with the procurement of a contractor, put contracts in place, and value the work on site. When acting as an employer’s agent or contract administrator, that role is a little more like project management because you’re often running meetings and dealing with day-to-day queries.<strong> </strong>

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So, what’s been keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I’ve been assisting on a project for Wiston Estate Winery. We’re helping expand their wine-producing capabilities and building out a tasting room, café, and whole tour experience. I’m also really excited to be working on a heritage project that involves the restoration of a Victorian structure called <a href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/madeira-terrace-restoration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Madeira Terraces</a>. You can’t miss it if you live in Brighton. But it’s been left degraded for quite a long time. When it’s restored, it will leave a great mark on the city.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That sounds like an awesome project, especially considering the history. Can you share more about it? </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> The idea is to restore it back to its heritage condition as a promenade and open area for the public to enjoy. It’s a really cool project, but restorations can be tricky, in particular when there are so many unknowns. In this case, the information we have on how it was built is limited, it’s also been closed for many years as its deemed unsafe. So, all of that can complicate a budget! We need to account for accessibility upgrades like stairs and lifts. And the client has big sustainability aspirations as well, they have an internal policy of becoming carbon neutral by 2030. It will be a big project that’s split into phases, but we’re keen to get it to site next year.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What a cool experience to be a part of. So, what led you to this position? </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I studied geography at university, and I was paired with a mentor who was a quantity surveyor. To be honest, I didn't know what that was! I spoke to him over the phone, and realized his work was making a big impact on the city of Brighton. I thought that was really cool. He set me up with work experience to learn more, and it took off from there!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You could say that! You mentioned you studied geography—what drew you to that initially? </strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>I always had an interest in global issues, current events, and sustainability. Geography tied all that together and involved learning skills that you can apply anywhere.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very true. So how long have you been doing this work?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> For just over two years now. And during that time, I’ve also completed a master’s in Quantity Surveying.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow. So, you’ve been busy! </strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>I suppose I have! My next step is to become a chartered Quantity Surveyor and completing the APC, or Assessment of Professional Competence. I’m in the process of that now, and Lloyd Evans is a brilliant mentor. It involves writing about your experience in a case study, professional development, and a big final interview. I’m hoping to sit for the interview in November next year.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Even though you learned about this path not too long ago, it seems like the perfect fit! What would your younger self think about your job today? </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I think she’d be impressed, definitely! Especially considering that in school you aren’t really introduced to these kinds of roles—especially as a female. If you had told me I'd be working in construction, getting boots on, and going on-site, I would have laughed! I didn’t think that was for me. But today, I love the variety of having an office job and also going on-site. And generally having an impact on the projects we work on. I find I’m constantly learning in this role, and I find that very interesting.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s great. Can you share a bit about your workplace culture? </strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>People are enthusiastic about their jobs. We are passionate about what we do, and always focused on exceeding client expectations. We know nothing is too much and that it’s our job to find the answer, even if it’s something you haven’t encountered before. We’re always learning and we’re really supportive of our team—even as we still work from home.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That kind of support is so important, and something we always aim to foster at MGAC. As you know, we’re closing the year on the heels of the exciting acquisition news—is there buzz in your office about what the future holds? </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> People are very excited. In early October, we were called up to the London office to hear the news and meet Mark Anderson. It was great that he was there, and we saw that this is important to him. It’s true that the fit is great. We have similar values and experience. It brings new opportunities for areas we don’t currently work in. And to have contacts in North America is exciting!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Continuing to look ahead, what impact do you hope to have through your work?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Impacting the city I live in is important to me. It’s so rewarding to see it develop in a positive way through projects like The Madeira Terraces. I used to walk past that area when I was younger, and I would wonder, “What’s going on here?” Now I’m a part of giving it a new life—and one that everyone here in Brighton can enjoy.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Talk about a rewarding project to deliver. </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Yes! There’s truly nothing more satisfying than seeing a job finish, and knowing you played a role in making that happen. It reminds you why you worked so hard, and why you always strive to do better.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like you’ve covered a lot of ground in your two years on the job. What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> One of the biggest has been completing my master’s in two years while working full-time—it’s probably the most difficult thing I've ever done!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> No kidding! What have you learned?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I've learned that you need determination in everything. And if you put the hours in, you’ll get the most out of it, and it will help your career. With projects on-site, I've learned that each has its challenges.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So true. Even though you’re still getting to know the people of MGAC, what about the firm has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> When we first met, they were so keen to talk about their projects and accomplishments. We knew we could get on board with them because of that energy and enthusiasm. Offering the whole package to existing clients is something we're really excited about. MGAC's project portfolio is impressive, we're really looking forward to working with one another.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! What would you say you have found the most rewarding about your job?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Being able to be supported through your job and openly ask questions. Seeing a project be completed from spending all that time on it. That feels hugely satisfying.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I like to wake up early and get a workout in. It keeps me alert throughout the day. It’s a great way to set the day up, especially when working from home.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I love listening to podcasts, in particular motivational ones. My latest listens <em>Happy Place with Fearne Cotton and On Purpose with Jay Shetty</em>.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I recently read <em>The Magic.</em> It’s a 28-day practice that opens your mind to being more grateful and manifesting good things. I believe in manifestation and think it’s a really cool thing to live by.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Some might say you embody that; with all you’ve accomplished in your career to date! In addition to becoming chartered, what else is on your list?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Helping others. I’d love to mentor someone and have an impact on their development—just like I’ve had the benefit of experiencing. In particular, I’d like to play a role in helping more females get into this industry.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s great! Now it’s time for some rapid-fire questions. Are you ready? </strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>I am!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> First up: Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Cost managing, problem solving.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Make a nice cup of tea and sit down to read emails.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And the last thing?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Since I work from home, it’s really just closing everything down and making sure I’m not leaving anything too daunting for the next day.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Maybe Christmas candles in early November?

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> If I’m at home, I love making a pizza wrap. It’s a great quick, warm lunch.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Either WhatsApp or Instagram.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Looking ahead, what’s your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Getting chartered, to get to that level would be a huge achievement.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> I’d love to have a key role in advancing the sustainability of construction, maybe even helping establish a department at MGAC | RLF. Helping everyone understand the importance of sustainability in a project. Often people throw the term sustainability around, but I would like to see us take more of an advisory role on making it happen. I strongly believe it’s going to become compulsory on our future developments.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> That’s hard...I’m like an open book! I used to be in a band; I played the guitar. I’d like to pick it up again sometime soon. Maybe that’s what I’ll do when I become chartered!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What was your favorite part of 2021?
</strong>

<strong>LL: </strong>I was promoted from assistant quantity surveyor to project surveyor. That was huge for me because it showed that all my hard work paid off.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What are you most excited for in the New Year? </strong>

<strong>LL:</strong> Many things! But I’m moving at the end of this year, so it will be a new start for me in 2022!

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/howard-price-25584914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Price</a> takes us on a tour of the iconic London building <a href="https://eighty-strand.co.uk/the-building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 Strand</a>, where the MGAC | RLF team provided project management, cost management, and principal designer services.

<hr />

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hello, I'm Howard Price and I'm a project director at RLF. I'm here today at our project, 80 Strand, in London for our client, Strandbrook Limited. Let's get moving.</em>

<em>80 Strand in London is a 13-story, iconic art deco building constructed in the 1930s. It sits in a prominent location on the River Thames. You'll arrive at the building from the inner courtyard and enter the building through the new steel glass entrance Pavilion.</em>

<em>And into the Pavilion reception, you'll enter a new double-height lobby space. The fit-out of approximately 160,000 square foot of office space over four floors. Lift lobbies were stripped back and existing stone wall cladding lift and lift front retained. New floors, ceilings, and fire rated glass screens have been installed. And new toilets, meeting and waiting rooms have been created. For the lift lobby, there's a cafe area and additional seating. The Contractor is still to hand over two floors of office space, further entrance area, and the basement due to be completed in the upcoming months.</em>

<em>I hope enjoyed seeing what's happening at 80 Strand. Follow us to see our next move.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded in 1996 with three goals: to do the most interesting and challenging work, to have fun working together, and to build a successful business in the process. Twenty-five years later, we have met these goals and more. At this milestone moment, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of our most memorable projects—our favorite missions made real.</em>

Over the past year, this series has given us the opportunity to revisit some of MGAC’s most fond memories—all of our “firsts,” our biggest wins, our wildest stories along the way. Our work began on a job that included buying, transporting, and then assembling a life-size skeleton cast of a Tyrannosaurus Rex—at a time where our team could be counted on two hands, and we hadn't yet made business cards—and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-discovery-channel-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>we made it happen</strong></a>. That same can-do firm has since moved highways, laid ocean cables, suspended a blue whale skeleton, and sourced rare materials from the far reaches of the earth on behalf of our clients.
<h4><strong>BUILDING A BUSINESS—AND A BETTER FUTURE</strong></h4>
What started as a project management and owner’s representative firm grew to encompass <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-ever-evolving-technology-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Technology Solutions</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-ffe-procurement-and-relocation-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FF&amp;E Procurement</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/relocation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Relocation Management</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-cost-management-and-project-controls-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Project Controls, and Cost Management</strong></a>—and so much <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/#nav_services" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>more</strong></a>. Along the way, we made a name for ourselves as a group willing to take on not only the biggest of asks, but projects that would exist as more than just brick and mortar, projects that truly endure. And that ethos has allowed us to dip our toes and develop expertise in virtually every sector shaping today’s built environment.

In the hospitality realm, we went from being asked <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-hospitality-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>how we had managed to get our foot in the door</strong></a> in meetings to building decades-long relationships with the world’s biggest names in the industry. In the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-building-cultural-landmarks-and-legacies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>cultural space</strong></a>, we have restored and raised national monuments, housed world-class art, and opened the doors to spaces that invite communities to contemplate and collectively experience the power of art. In the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/25-years-of-mgac-corporate-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>corporate sector</strong></a>, we have helped powerhouse companies truly live their values and have redefined what it means to build a workspace marrying form and function while pushing the envelope on innovation. We have partnered with all levels of educational institutions—from local grade schools to the Ivy League on forward-looking learning spaces. We have gone to work on the buildings and hallowed halls that keep the governments of the world running. Hospitals, laboratories, luxury living spaces—you name it, we have worked there.

Over the years, we have done and seen so many things, made countless “what ifs” a reality, and have so many memories we look back on fondly. We are proud of how far we have come, how much we have grown. Our once six-person team now looks a bit bigger. We went from a DC-based company to a coast-to-coast company, to a North American company when we took a leap and opened our doors to our first international office in Canada. Now, we have expanded our footprint even further by welcoming <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-acquires-rlf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>four new offices in the UK</strong></a>. No matter the project, no matter the new adventure, everything always comes back to one thing: <strong>finding the very best people in the business and putting them first, always. </strong>
<h4><strong>MANY PERSPECTIVES, ONE SHARED PASSION</strong></h4>
At MGAC, our success has always been rooted in our people. We built this company with folks who were willing to take on anything without a second thought, ready to roll up their sleeves to pull off the unthinkable. People with integrity, creativity, and enthusiasm. That is where we started in April of 1996, and in the months and years since, we have grown by finding that spark in others. Today, we are proud to have built an award-winning <a href="https://www.mgac.com/culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>culture</strong></a>, and work every day to ensure tomorrow is even better through <a href="https://www.mgac.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives</strong></a>, and by hiring team members who push our capabilities and our passions further. That could not be truer than in this moment, as we welcome our newest members of the MGAC family in the UK.

Beyond our own team, we are fortunate to have built longstanding relationships with talented colleagues across the AEC industry, and with clients who have put their trust in us to help bring their biggest dreams to life. It is humbling to leave your mark on communities around the world in a tangible way. It is an honor to take someone else’s vision and make it your own. It is also just plain fun to do what we do every day. They say time flies when you are having fun and, from where we stand, we have not slowed down yet.]]></content:encoded>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, everyone, and welcome to "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast digging into the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. As always, I want to preface this podcast by letting you know that we're not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion, we just want to share our stories, our experiences, and discuss how together we can create a better outcome for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. So with that, I'm Bryan Gamez, your host. I'm an Assistant Project Manager at MGAC working and living in Los Angeles, California. And today, we have the honor of talking with Isabella. So, Isabella, do you want to tell us a little about yourself? Introduce yourself to our listeners.

Isabella: Sure. My name is Isabella Villegas. I'm from Toronto. I'm the Vice President of Project Management here in our Toronto office, and I run the Canadian side of things for MGAC. I've been with the company for about a year, and I'm very excited to be part of this podcast series.

Bryan: And we're really happy to have you, Isabella. I'm excited to include your perspective and let's dig into your identity. Can you tell us what group that you identify with?

Isabella: I identify as a female. I was born in Canada, but I was raised in Mexico. My parents are Mexican. They're from Monterrey, Mexico. It's funny because I always tell people that I'm Mexican. And when people hear that I was born in Canada, they're like, "But you were born in Canada." I'm like, "Yeah, but I identify as a Mexican. Like, I identify as a Latina." I was born in Sault Ste. Marie. It's about eight hours north of Toronto to Northern Ontario.

Bryan: Wow.

Isabella: Yeah. And when I was six months old, my parents decided to go back to Mexico. So we went back to Mexico, and I lived there until I was about 14 and then we moved back to Sault Ste. Marie. So I finished elementary school and then high school in Sault Ste. Marie. I went to university and I traveled a lot through university but then after that, I settled in Toronto, and I've been here now for about, I think, almost 20 years.

Bryan: Oh, wow. So I'm actually, my family is Guatemalan so we're kind of neighbors.

Isabella: Oh.

Bryan: Yeah. And I was born here in the United States, but I identify as Latino. So I understand exactly what you mean. I've never gotten pushback on, you know, the way I look and whatnot but that's really, really cool. And Monterrey is a beautiful city. So you've been in Canada for you said 20 years. Have you ever faced any challenges because of your identity as a female Latina?

Isabella: No. It's interesting because...well, you can see me because we're on Zoom. But when people look at me, they don't think I'm Latina. They think I either married into it because of my last name or just because of my complexion. It's interesting that even nowadays you still hear people say, "Oh, you don't look Mexican." And it's interesting because I'm like, you know, there's a lot of bare skin, blue-eyed Mexicans, but people are so used to, like, the stereotypical, their perception of what a Mexican looks like.

When I meet people, they don't assume or they don't connect the dots that I'm Latina or that my family is Latina. So I've never faced a lot of things like that but my family has. Like, my dad is dark-skinned and he faces it all the time. And my partner now, he's Peruvian and he looks Latina. So I see it from their perspective. And it's just interesting to see that I don't get treated differently.

Bryan: That's such a great point. I have so many Mexican friends and also family members. I'm tan but I haven't faced discrimination like my brother who's darker, has darker complexion, or had darker complexion. It's always made me feel uncomfortable when you see it happening to your family members, the discrimination. So how does that make you feel and how have you addressed it? How does it affect you personally and even psychologically?

Isabella: More than anything, it's just anger, right? Because when somebody mistreats anybody, your family or your close friends or whatever, you want to, right away, my instinct is just to defend. So from that perspective, it's more like the anger and the, I guess, in a way, it's anger with myself too thinking that, "I can't believe this is happening," right? Like, I can't believe this is still happening to you. Like, whether it's my dad or my partner or some of my cousins. And then I feel anger towards the situation. But I also feel anger towards myself that I still get surprised by it. It's interesting that I'm still in shock, I guess, when things like that happen because I feel like it's something that shouldn't be happening.

Bryan: Absolutely. And I think that we live in a very social media digital age at this point where you see things online and you see these viral videos, and they exist elsewhere in the world. But when it happens to you and you experience it firsthand, I get what you're saying, you feel, like, this anger. I feel more a disappointment that people face that every day. That's unfortunate. And I hope that you've been able to confront those challenges. How have you been able to confront them?

Isabella: More than anything it's just talking it through. And like you said, stepping back and becoming a little bit calm. It comes back to educating people about what they're saying and how they're saying and how they're making others feel and, like, the emotions. When you present people with how others are feeling or how you're feeling and you express how you're feeling verbally, it kind of resets the conversation in the situation, right?

Bryan: Communication.

Isabella: Mm-hmm. For example, like my husband, he's in a store by himself and he gets followed around a store. He's in the store with me and nobody bothers him.

Bryan: Does that still happen to your husband?

Isabella: Yeah. He was in a fancy furniture store a few months ago. And I have gone to a fancy furniture store with him and, nothing. Like, the people came in. They're like, "What can we help you with?" And then he went by himself to pick up stuff and he was just waiting and walking around and the salesperson was following him around. And, to me, like, that makes me so upset because it's like you don't even know this person.

Bryan: There's a judgment and a stereotype. Right.

Isabella: So when we went back into the store, I said, "I want to come with you. I want to, like, see what's going on."

Bryan: Experience that.

Isabella: And I just expressed my feelings. I'm like, "You're making me feel very upset that you're following my husband around for no reason." And the salesperson is like, "Oh." He just like snapped out of it and he was in a bit of a shock. He's like, "I didn't even realize that I was doing that," or, "I didn't realize that my actions were making you uncomfortable," right? And he could have been doing it intentionally or maybe not. Like, we don't know, right? But I find that once you just speak about how you're feeling about certain things, most of the times people just kind of reset a little bit and be like, "Oh, I didn't even realize that that was what I was doing.

Bryan: First, I'm really sorry to hear that that has happened to both you and your husband and that he's experienced that. Because, one, he shouldn't experience that. I know plenty of people who have experienced that. But communicating with that salesperson is definitely the first step. And I think a lot of people now on minority groups do challenge whoever is following them, and that's good...

I think that's the right thing to do and say, "Hey, why are you following me?" The hope is that that person, as you said, resets, first apologizes, and then, you know, treats you like a human being. Because none of us deserve to feel that way. We don't deserve to walk into a space feel uncomfortable. And hopefully, as we move forward, that's exactly where we're heading and trending.

Isabella: Yeah. From that perspective, I think I personally faced it. It's been more like my husband and my dad who have faced more of that type of discrimination.

Bryan: I had a similar conversation with Yanet Martinez, who's here in the Los Angeles office, and she's Latina. And I wanted to ask this question because I'm Latino, but I'm lighter-skinned, gay in the construction industry, and I've always felt like sometimes uncomfortable. But being Latinos, there are a lot of Latinos on-site and being project managers. Have you ever faced a situation where you're on-site and you faced or saw anyone being discriminated against because of, like, how they, you know, just because of their minority group, and have you ever confronted that challenge? It's just an interesting question because I always feel bad when I see fellow Latinos. And I'm just like, "No, I'm here with you. I'm your partner."

Isabella: I've been on a lot of construction sites where there's a lot of Latinos. I was on a project recently. It was a big project and there was a lot of Latinos on site. And they didn't realize that I was Latino and that I spoke Spanish, right? But I always heard them speaking Spanish and things like that. And one time, I overheard a conversation where they were scared to ask to leave early because they had to go to an appointment.

So they were speaking in Spanish and they were scared because they don't want to get fired, they don't want to break the rules, all these things, right? And for me, it was more advocating for them. So I stepped in and I said, "You guys don't have to worry about this. If you guys are performing, you can ask to leave early for an appointment. Like, you don't have to fear your job security because of that," right?

And they didn't speak English. So when they heard me speak Spanish, A, they were surprised. They were like, "Oh, we didn't know you speak Spanish". And B, "Thanks for, like, explaining this to us." So not that I've seen them being mistreated, but more so that just because they don't feel as comfortable with their situation. I feel like there's a bit of fear, especially when it's recent immigrants or people that are uncomfortable in the new environment.
They have a little bit of fear that they don't want to, you know, ruffle any feathers or say anything that might get them in trouble. And again, it's just more about education and speaking up for them and telling them. And vice versa, like, letting their superiors know how they're feeling so that both feelings can calm down.

Bryan: Right. That's a really great point because I feel that when I'm on-site, I'm always there to be an advocate for others, Latinos, and I speak four languages. So I try to, you know, let everyone know, especially in this day and age that, "We're on your side. I'm here to help. I'm here to just communicate relation." I've heard conversations about job security and how to address that with project managers who tend to be white men or and who don't speak Spanish. So I'm happy that we're able to bridge the conversation, quite literally, with our identities and languages.

Isabella: Yeah.

Bryan: Isabella, have you ever faced discrimination from your employer or people in positions of power because of how you identify as a Latina woman?

Isabella: Not so much in terms of how I identify as a Latina woman, but in terms of inequality when it comes to people that have money versus those that don't. I grew up in Mexico, like we discussed. And when we moved to Canada, we didn't have a lot of money. So my parents were the immigrants working three jobs just to put food on the table and working hard night shifts and things like that. So when we lived in Mexico, we had a house, we had a car. It wasn't a mansion, but it was ours, right?

And then when we moved to Canada, we didn't have any of that. When we moved to this small town, we were able to get assistance. So we moved into, like, community housing, social housing. And it was a nice townhouse. And I was like, "Oh, this is great. We're living in a townhouse. And it's a nice, three-bedroom townhouse." My siblings and I thought it was great. And then we went to school and we were made fun of for living in community housing, for being poor.

For me, that was a very first taste of discrimination, maybe not so much position of power, but people that had the knee that we didn't have. And that's more what I witnessed growing up as a kid, as a teenager, is like not having money. You know, you don't have the money to buy the clothes. You don't have the money to go to the concerts or play certain activities or certain things. That, for me, was my first big kind of aha moment where I was like, "Oh, we don't have money and society doesn't think that's a good thing. The fact that we're poor is a negative."

And, to me, my parents are hardworking. My mom had three jobs. So for me, I thought it was like, "My mom is working so hard. She's so great. And they're working so hard to put food on the table and to give us a better education. And they could have gone back home, but they chose not to. They chose to stay here." It's interesting, as a grown-up, obviously, like went to school, went to university, got a career, and trying to make sure that I had the means. And that was a big goal of mine because game poor pushed me to understand you have to have a job with security and benefits and things like that.

Bryan: Your story, I'm being serious when I say this, that it makes me, like, emotional because I feel like what you're describing is how my family has been. And socioeconomic status is definitely... It's a huge issue here in America. Also, as you say, in Canada. I'm intrigued to know how has that affected you in the long run now that you're a vice president at our firm. So I'm just interested to know how it has affected you at your position now.

Isabella: The hard-working aspect, it's been like the number one thing. You work hard for what you want. If you want a certain type of education, you got to work for it. My mom especially, she was always like, "Nothing is gonna come easy to you because we don't have the means. We don't have the money. So you're going to have to work extra hard to get that scholarship. You're gonna have to work extra hard to, you know, stay with that scholarship in school to get grants. You're going to have to figure out a way to get through school, through university."

Because I went to architecture, and it was a seven-year program. So my mom is like, "How are we going to afford a seven-year program? There's no way." So luckily, in Canada, there's a lot of government support with loans and things like that. But I also picked a school that had a paid internship program. So every four months, I got to work and it was paid. For the seven years, I worked and saved and paid for school and things like that. And when I came out of school, I said, "Okay, I want to enjoy my career but I also want to be comfortable and I want to help my mom and my siblings so they can also finish their careers and move together."

So the circumstances just pushed me to work hard but it also didn't actually push me to get things in terms of, like, material things. Because after a certain point, you realize the material stuff that everybody has doesn't really get you places. Like, it doesn't really matter. It's about the work ethic. You can have parents that are really well off and have a lot of money, but if they don't instill the work ethic in you, it's gonna get you anywhere.

Or if they don't instill the values in you to be respectful and to listen to people and communicate well, like, it's not really going to get you anywhere. And I feel like in our profession, that communication, sometimes we have like 20, 30 people around the table and figuring out how to navigate that conversation so that everyone is heard. Those are skills that money doesn't really buy.

Bryan: We can't buy. You cannot buy those skills. Exactly.

Isabella: So I think growing up without money made me a problem solver, figuring out different options to get to my next step to get to where I wanted to go next. And I think that led me to this profession because, like, that's what we do all day long, right, is just solve.

Bryan: We're solving problems and facilitating issues. Yeah, exactly, exactly. We're also dealing with a lot of money.

Isabella: So I think that, more than anything, there's always a solution. Something is not going to come easy to you, but figure it out. Figure out what the solution is or what the next step is going to be or how you're going to get to the end result.

Bryan: Absolutely. I do want to know, because of how you just delve into socioeconomic status, have you ever had to adapt in the workplace, you talk about education and growing up, but in the workplace, because of how you identified growing up?

Isabella: There's a lot of junior people that I've mentored along the way and some of them have come from a similar background as me. And they're nervous about certain things. A couple of times, I've had interns where they just didn't have a credit card or they didn't have enough money because they're paying off their student loans and things like that. And just having a frank conversation with them to be like, "You know what, it's okay. You don't have to explain your situation to us. We're here to support. So whatever it is you're facing, let's just talk about it." And we kind of figured those things out.

Bryan: It sounds like you're really a great mentor, Isabella.

Isabella: It's more about understanding the individual circumstances. When it comes to the socioeconomic stuff, you don't know anybody's story or how they grew up or how they came to where they are. I always try to just have open conversations and to say, "If there's something, you know, that you're struggling with, we're not here to judge. It's a professional setting. We're here to be supportive. And if there's something that you need, just talk about it," right?

Bryan: You're leaving yourself open to conversation to understand where they're coming from. And that's honestly the first step.

Isabella: But I think sometimes people think it's embarrassing.

Bryan: And it's not.

Isabella: It's not. When we were poor, I was made to feel embarrassed, embarrassed that I was poor. And then once I grew up, I reflected on it. I'm like, "Why was I embarrassed of my parents being hard working," right? It's such a weird thing that society puts in our heads, that you have to be embarrassed because of it. And it's not something that you wake up and you say, "Oh, I choose to be poor," or, "I choose to be this way," right?

Bryan: That is exactly what happened with me when I was growing up. My dad was a landscaper and my mom was a housekeeper. And I just remember thinking...I grew up in an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C. As I grew up, I was like, "I wish I wasn't Latino or I wish my father wasn't a landscaper or whatnot." But I think to myself now, "My parents did a lot and sacrificed a lot to put food on the table and give us the best education."

And now I'm very proud of what they've done instilled in me. So what you're saying makes complete sense. And there's no room to... People who are listening shouldn't be embarrassed of how they were raised or what their background is because it helps develop character and has developed me, who I am as a person, and also as you, Isabella, so.

Isabella: When I'm mentoring or where I'm in the workforce, that's my number one thing is, like, who are we to judge where you came from or who you are? Go back to having that real talk to say, "This A, B, and C is an issue and let's figure out how to resolve it and how to make you comfortable."

Bryan: Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's what we're trying to achieve here. Why is diversity, equity, and inclusion so important in the workplace? I want to know your thoughts on that?

Isabella: I think it's because if you're gonna preach innovation, you have to be an example of it, right? And how can you be innovative without having diverse everything? Diverse talk, diverse view, diverse personality, diverse people. And how can you be innovative and forward-thinking if you're not including a wide range of opinions and a wide range of background? Everybody has an idea when you're conversing about how to solve an issue. And that idea comes from their background, right? It comes from where they've been and what they've seen. If you don't allow that into your surroundings, into your work environment, to me, it's a bit backwards.

Bryan: Absolutely.

Isabella: If you want a company to, like, follow a manual, write that manual and don't change ever from that manual. But if you want a company to, you know, contribute to the world and contribute to society, you got to be diverse and you got to be open to including those opinions, those backgrounds, those thoughts.

Bryan: Absolutely. And also I think that's why I really enjoy working with MGAC. I think we have so many diverse backgrounds at this company and we all learned a really great perspective, voice, and opinions to our clients in meetings. So I agree with you on that point. As project managers, you know, part of our job is to help our clients develop teams. We're creating equitable spaces and we're creating the books environment. What are some of the ways that the AEC industry can impact change?

Isabella: I think by giving more opportunity, more well-grounded opportunity across the board. And what I mean by that is there's this view of having this org chart, the junior people reporting up to intermediate to senior to the higher up. And I think that idea of the org chart is so backwards. I think it needs to be more a 360 view of a company. And I feel like allowing opinions and thoughts and thinking to come from all levels is good. Understanding what the junior team thinks of the senior team.

I remember being in a performance evaluation kind of session. And I asked for the junior PM on my team to come into my performance evaluation because I wanted to understand what they thought of me, right? Not just what my boss thought of me. But I also want to know am I doing a good job mentoring and working with the junior people? For me, I think it's not so much in terms of levels. I think we just started looking at if we're talking about diversity and inclusion, what does it mean from a 360 perspective? And that's just...

Bryan: It's not a static linear item. Right. And I think that I agree with you. And you were one of the first few people that have talked about performance evaluations and seeking who is at a higher, I would say, "position," right, as a vice president, from your junior staff members. I think I love that idea. And it sounds like you have lent a helping hand and also have been such a great mentor and you're also very self-aware. And I think that awareness also lends to inclusivity, equality, which is what we are seeking as well in our jobs and with our clients. So that's a great perspective.

Isabella: Understanding what the team as a whole thing is so important. And, again, it shouldn't be about status. It shouldn't be about what you have or what level you sit at. It should be just about respecting everybody's opinion. And sometimes it might not be great but at least you hear it.

Bryan: You take it in. Yes, exactly.

Isabella: You take it in, you know? And you peel away at it. And I think we have to do a little bit more of that.

Bryan: That actually leads me into my next question, which is such a great segue. What advice would you give younger staff members or younger people who are looking to be or have a career in the AEC industry?

Isabella: I always believe that you have to immerse yourself into different aspects of our profession. When I was younger, my grandma used to be like, "Okay, go mop the floor." And one day I said to her, "Grandma, one day I'm going to have money then I'm going to have a housekeeper."

Bryan: What did she say to that, your Abuela? That's your abuelita?

Isabella: And she's like, "But if you don't know how to mop the floor, how are you going to know that she did a good job or not? She might use a broom. She might use the towel that you use to, like, wrap your tortillas in."

Bryan: Classic.

Isabella: Yeah. She's like, "How are you going to know that she did a good job if you don't know what it means to do a good job?" So I always think of that. And when I talk to younger people, I say, "You have to learn what it means to do part A of a project, part B of a project, part C of a project. You can't just rely on others to do those things, at least at the beginning when you're learning. Because you're never going to understand what they're giving you if it's going to be, like, a value or if it's going to meet the client's expectations if you don't know how to do it."

So I'm not saying you have to be like a specialist and an expert at it but you do need to figure out how to mop those floors so that you understand what you're getting. You have to have experience and you have to have a well-rounded experience especially in our profession to know that you're getting value from someone else later on down the road.

Bryan: You know, younger people shouldn't feel intimidated or scared to jump into the profession. You're going to meet people like us who are going to be there to help you.

Isabella: Oh, definitely.

Bryan: I'm speaking to Isabella, a Vice President, and, you know, well, I'm more junior. You're surrounding yourself with an environment where we care for our colleagues and we care for your success because your success is everyone's success.

Isabella: Exactly. Yeah. That is a big thing. For me, I always feel like I need to support my team because if they do well then I'm doing well. Whatever it is that they need, I am like, "I will support you with that because it means one less headache for me if you are performing well, right? If you want to take a course or if you want to get experience in a specific area. Let's go for it. Let's do it. I will be there to help you."

Bryan: I love it, Isabella. I want to be on your project team. That's what I want. Go to Canada, go to Toronto. Now I want to know where do you see diversity in our industry in 10 years? How do we normalize the conversation on diversity?

Isabella: It is interesting. I was on a ULI conference yesterday, Urban Land Institute, and there was a woman on there who said, "We need to make a movement. Like we need to stop talking about it and actually create a movement." She was saying, "I'm so tired of the word conversation because it's got to move away from conversation to what's the action plan? How do we move forward?" So I'm hoping that in 10 years, we're not talking about it anymore. We've actioned these things, forcing, like, an industry where there's women and men and it just becomes about the work.

Bryan: Right. Right. And I think where in being as inclusive as possible that the employees in the firm reflect diverse perspectives, diverse backgrounds. We lent our lived-in experiences to our project teams. And at that point, it's a cohesive team environment and that's going to lead to, as you said before, innovation and also the success of the firm.

Isabella: Yeah. I hope that in 10 years we're not talking about how we can be. I hope we just are.

Bryan: You know, I don't know if all our listeners know what the Urban Land Institute is. Was it just a specific diversity forum that you were on?

Isabella: Yeah. It's a committee. One of our vice presidents actually here in Toronto, he was heading the Women's Leadership Initiative there. It's a big institute.

Bryan: I'm happy to hear that they had diversity in a female leadership forum. I think it was a great opportunity for everyone to be involved with. Let's talk about MGAC. How do you think that we should integrate diversity and inclusion here at our firm?

Isabella: I think it's already part of our company. We have so many diverse backgrounds and diverse perspectives. It's more so about sharing what those backgrounds are. How do you bring A and B together to coexist? And I think we're already there. When I was researching the company and I was trying to decide whether to be part of it or not, I was so happy. I had the biggest smile on my face because I saw so many women on the website...

Bryan: I love that. Yeah.

Isabella: ...as like VPs and managing directors. Because usually, in our industry, you see a lot of males leading the company. And just the different backgrounds and perspectives that we bring from the different offices. We could always do more. How do we celebrate it now, right? Like, how do we...?

Bryan: I love that. That's such a great way. That's a great aha moment for me, Isabella. How do we celebrate DEI in our own company? It's interesting because I've been focused on integrating it or the idea of, like, baking this into our DNA. But I like, moving forward, that we are celebrating our experiences. Isabella, that's a great way to think about it. I love that. And also, you're in a position of leadership. And I think that's amazing that you've been able to lend your stories and lend your experiences and be in this firm at your level. And I think that is a reflection of how MGAC is moving forward in the industry and being at the forefront of what diversity and equality and inclusion is like. So I love that you're saying we should celebrate it and continue to celebrate it.

Isabella: We are all so lucky to be in this company where the leadership is focused on making it better. It's not just a static thing. They want to embed it into your every day with us. I'm hopeful that we're going to be actioning items and celebration can be an action, right?

Bryan: Right. I think MGAC isn't trying to tokenize anyone. Kudos to our founder, Mark Anderson, for helping establish this forum and having us speak about our backgrounds and experiences. So I totally understand where you're coming from, Isabella, and I love that. I'm going to move forward with the celebration. For some of our coworkers who have never faced discrimination, how can they be an ally to those who come from diverse backgrounds? What would your advice be to them?

Isabella: It comes just with having an open mind and educating ourselves. We obviously don't know everything there is to know. But I think being receptive, being engaged, and being open in terms of the ability to embrace somebody's story. Just allowing yourself to say, "I'm here. Whatever we need to discuss or let's talk about it without judgment." We're great at talking, right, but we're not so good at listening. I don't know why. Maybe it's a scientific thing, you know, one thing develops more than the other. And I do that too. Sometimes when you're in a conversation, your mind is thinking about what you're going to say next as opposed to really just focusing on what the person is saying, focusing and tuning in into people's stories. I think that's the number one thing.

Bryan: Absolutely. I mean, I understand that. You hit the nail on the head. It's about embracing each other. It's about being in the now, listening to the person you're speaking to. That's how you engage with them. I've had such a great opportunity engaging with you today, listening to your story. And I'm embracing you.

Isabella: Thank you.

Bryan: You have been such a pleasure to speak to, Isabella. And I hope that our listeners resonate with what you've experienced growing up from being a Latina female and also your stories about socioeconomic status. Because that's something that we haven't really talked about. It's still something that affects people today. And we're here to understand each other's backgrounds. So I really thank you for sharing those experiences, Isabella.

Isabella: Thank you. It's been great. It's just fun. I think you're doing a fantastic job by the way.

Bryan: Thank you so much. You've been such a pleasure. And to all our listeners, thank you for listening to this episode of "MGAC Inner Voices." I hope that you guys come back next month and check out our next episode. Thanks, everyone.

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-gordon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casey Gordon</a>, Vice President at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Casey!</strong>

<strong>Casey Gordon (CG):</strong> Hi! Thanks for having me.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Let’s start with what you do here at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I’m a Vice President focused on project management in the Los Angeles office.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And how long have you been with the company?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Almost 5 years now. I was actually the second project manager to be hired for the Los Angeles office, which began primarily as a cost management team.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Nice! How did your professional path lead you to MGAC?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I practiced architecture in New York for 10 years prior to moving to Los Angeles, where I started working as a general contractor. During the 2008 recession, I moved over to construction management on the owner’s side, where I did a lot of work in healthcare and for the County of Los Angeles. From there, because my background combined design and engineering as well as construction and contracting, I was able to speak a lot of “languages” that would benefit the owner’s side. So, it was a natural fit for me to make that shift and start to represent owners.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely. It sounds like your diverse experience has really positioned you well for what you’re doing today.</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> You could say that. One of the things I enjoy about MGAC is that, like myself, a lot of people here have diverse backgrounds. That wide breadth of expertise is one of the things that’s very attractive to me about MGAC as a firm.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>You mentioned you started out as an architect. Was that something you had been interested in pursuing since you were young?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I grew up wanting to go into art. And I realized early on that architecture, being the only art requiring a license to practice, seemed like a nice blend of my interest in art and my more meticulous skills—I’ve always been fascinated with how things come together. Then, once I actually started working in architecture, I found that I appreciated the personal relationships with clients even more than the design aspect.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That makes sense. Now that your role has evolved from those original architect aspirations, what would that younger self think about your job today?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Well, like a lot of other people, I think he’d ask me what I really do! Because at MGAC, we do so many different things. I think once the younger me saw the scale of projects that we work on, the complexity of the work, and the exciting clients we work for, he’d be pretty impressed.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span> Speaking of projects and clients, what’s keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I often joke that I'm always the most boring guy at the party because many of the awesome projects I work on are under NDAs. For example, right now, we are working on a professional sports team’s headquarters and practice facility. At 115,000 SF, it includes three practice fields and an indoor / outdoor workout gym. We are also kicking off a $50M private residence in Wyoming, for a high-net-worth individual. We recently met with the architect on that project, and the designs are amazing.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What an exciting mix of work!</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> It really is! In Los Angeles, we do a little bit of everything. We just wrapped two large luxury residential developments—<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/asteras-kings/221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astéras Kings</a> in West Hollywood and Windsor Row (previously known as <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-on-the-move-van-ness-residences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Van Ness Residences</a>) in Los Angeles—with one more scheduled to complete in August of this year. That project, in North Hollywood, is called Hyperion. It comprises 14 townhomes on a steep and tiered site that required a lot of civil work. But that also means it has beautiful views of all of Los Angeles.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> No doubt it will be rewarding to carry that across the finish line! When you think about your time at MGAC, what impact do you hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> At MGAC, we pride ourselves on delivering difficult and challenging projects for our clients. My goal is to always maintain that high standard, while also encouraging everyone to enjoy the process—not only our project managers, but also our clients. Because, let’s face it, people don’t often call us when things are easy. They call us when they have a big problem to solve, a major challenge on their hands. Coming up with solutions can be incredibly taxing at times. The key, really, is learning how to manage these difficult situations long-term. To have fun not only in projects, but in your career.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Basically, keeping your eye on the bigger picture.</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Exactly. When you see project managers who are truly great at what they do, they can calm a client and get the team firing on all cylinders at the same time. On any given project, we’re overseeing a large group of individual teams. So, we must bring everyone together and inspire the team by reminding them we all have the same agenda. Our job is to de-personalize things and help us stay on track of our ultimate goal. Be hard on the problem, not on the people.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I like to say that I see opportunities, not challenges. But I think the biggest challenge in my time at MGAC to-date has been the COVID-19 pandemic. While our team has done a great job working remotely, it’s undeniable that, in a remote work setting, you lose the ability to absorb new ideas on projects you aren’t involved in. You simply don’t get to see other teams solve problems that aren’t directly related to you.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Very true. How have you addressed that?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> We’ve combatted that by spending more time in the field. I’ve encouraged our people to tour projects they weren’t involved on, because it became more pointed and necessary to keep the team aware of what’s happening on other job sites.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Mentorship, absolutely. I have 26-plus years of experience in the industry, and it’s important to me to use that to help others with their career trajectory. I’m fortunate to have had the pleasure of working with a lot of people early in their career development. Drawing on the cadence and caliber of some of our projects, I’ve been able to share insights on management and client relations, and also find out what they would like to excel at as they grow their careers. While it’s personally gratifying for me, it also can be a great way to reduce staff attrition. I’m proud to say that, among Project Managers in Los Angeles, we have only grown in the last five years.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s incredible. Outside that opportunity for serving as a mentor, what at MGAC would you say has most made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> It has solidified my sense of camaraderie. One of the things I really appreciate about MGAC is that everyone genuinely likes to help everyone else. When you have a problem, you can fire off an email to the firm, and you’ll get actual responses. It’s one of the only places I've worked where that is the case. People here aren’t just looking out for themselves. There’s not a sense that you’re competing for the next promotion or the next client. We all recognize that when a client is happy, it reflects well on the whole company.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! It sounds like you tackle a lot every day on the job. What is your secret to starting each morning on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> The beach. I surf and cycle. I make a point to get out every morning because I’m the type of person who, if I don’t do activity in the morning, it ain’t gonna happen.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Name a book that has made a significant impact on your life.</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. (Spoiler alert: It’s not actually about motorcycle maintenance, though motorcycles are involved.) It’s about a man’s journey into the definition of the word “quality” and how that impacts society. It’s a bit of a cult classic. While you know quality when you see it, it’s a hard term to actually define. The book really resonated with me in architecture school, and I've probably read the book three times across the course of my life. And each time I revisit it, it has had a different meaning to me.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Nice. How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> There are so many, but I particularly like this one from Count Basie, the jazz musician. “Learn to deal with the valleys, and the hills will take care of themselves.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I’d like to impact others by inspiring them to be the best version of themselves they can be. As a dad, as a husband, as a friend. And, again, to enjoy the journey—that’s always been a big one for me. I think we get too focused on the prize, but it’s rarely about that. It’s really all about the journey.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>In our final stage of the Impact Blog, we like to ask a few rapid-fire questions. Are you ready for them?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Let’s do it!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. That’s actually a quote attributed to Leonardo da Vinci (among other smart people), but I think it touches everything we do for our clients. Understanding complicated or complex issues and providing the shortest and most direct route to a well-designed solution is the key to a successful project.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I say good morning to my team—before I pepper them with questions!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the last thing?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I close my laptop until the next morning. I think of it like putting a bookmark in your book and placing it on your nightstand.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> I have a calendar of 2022 full moons on my desk right now.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> A reference for surfing?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Partially. But I have always liked to know the phases of the moons simply because they’re cool astronomically.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> If I eat out, I love this place called Sweet Fin. I order the spicy tuna poke bowl.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Yum. What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Spotify.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s a first! What's your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> On the whole, I’d say I’m approaching it like I would any other year. My goal is to create lasting relationships through happy clients.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Not wearing a mask? Just kidding. (Sort of.) Beyond that, I really just hope to be continuing to learn, refining my skills, and building new and existing relationships.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>CG:</strong> Many people probably don’t know that I'm a command pilot for a philanthropic organization called <a href="https://www.angelflightwest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angel Flight West</a>. We provide the underserved community air transportation to medical care and treatments, at no cost to them. So sometimes when I’m not at work, I’m up in the clouds!

<em>The building process is complex and comes with common—and not-so-common—challenges. Learn more about what we do as Project Managers in our monthly video series, MGAC on the Move. Each month a different member of our team will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at one of their current projects. Now let’s get moving!</em>

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdavies241/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Davies</a> gives us a tour of the recently completed <a href="https://rlf.co.uk/case-studies/case-study-york-st-john-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">York St John University Creative Centre</a>. The MGAC | RLF team provided project management, cost management, and principal designer services for this purpose-built creative space spanning three floors and featuring a 200-seat theatre and teaching facilities for the University’s creative and computing courses.

<em>VIDEO TRANSCRIPTION</em>

<em>Hello, I'm Matt Davies. Project Manager with MGAC RLF. I'm here today at the new Creative Centre at York St. John University. Let's get moving.</em>

<em>The newly built Creative Centre essentially comprises three individual buildings. A teaching block, recycle rooms, and an auditorium, which are all linked by an impressive triple atrium. It has strong sustainability credentials backed by a formal environmental assessment process. The glazed atrium and recycle room balcony is arranged to give views out towards the iconic York Minster. The focal point within the large atrium is the wide feature staircase. The area also serves as a collaborative working and exhibition space.</em>

<em>High quality teaching accommodations include high-ceilinged, acoustically treated music rooms, theatrical workshop space, fully equipped computer and research labs, as well as a state-of-the-art critical listening room.</em>

<em>A primary feature of the Creative Centre is the new auditorium, housing a theatrical stage and pit, multi-tiered seating and elevated working level. It is equipped to present a range of productions.</em>

<em>I hope you've enjoyed seeing what's been happening at York St. John University. Follow us to see our next move.</em>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, and welcome to "MGAC Inner Voices," a podcast digging into the issue of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. As always, we wanna preface this podcast by letting you know that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We wanna share our stories and discuss how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond.

I am Brian Gamez, project manager at MGAC, working and living in Los Angeles. I'm your podcast host. And today is a really exciting day be because we're speaking with the one and only Meredith Sonnen. We have worked together on a few projects now. I will let them introduce themselves.

Meredith: Hi, I'm Meredith Sonnen and I'm the one and only. That was a great introduction. That made me feel good. I'm a project manager and creative producer in the industry. Specifically, I work mostly in experiential design and television and live events and things as well. So, Jack of all trades, just I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good creative solution and that's always what I'm looking for. And I live in Jersey City and I work mostly in the New York area but as Bryan knows, I am one wont to fly across the country an awful lot for work. So, I'm all over these days.

Bryan: Yeah. Meredith and I have worked on a few projects now and I can concur that we definitely know how to dig into a spreadsheet but they make a really good spreadsheet. So, I really appreciate Meredith and I'm really excited today too because Meredith, you're our first external consultant that we're speaking to on "MGAC Inner Voices." So, you are our first "external voice." So, you know, I'm really happy to have you on. I think this is gonna be a great conversation.

Meredith: I'm honored to be invited. I didn't realize I was the first, like, outside influence on the podcast. It's a lot of responsibility but I'm excited.

Bryan: I know you'll carry it well, Meredith. So, Meredith, can you talk to us about what marginalized group that you most associate with and how that has affected you in the professional space?

Meredith: Yeah. So, first things first, my pronouns are they, them, for anyone that's been listening and catching that. So, I'm queer and I identify as non-binary. I also wanna state that I know most people read me as a woman. And so at times in this podcast, I might lump myself in with the experience of being a woman or a fem in the industry and what that feels like. Because of the way people perceive me, I can't avoid holding both of those identities sometimes because of the identities that are both put upon me and the identity that I hold within myself.

And so I'm always holding both those things. So, it might sound confusing to anyone who is unfamiliar with, like, gender representation that I am both at times talking about the experience of being a fem in the industry and also talking about the experience of having, you know, non-binary pronouns and being non-binary. But all of those things exist at the same time and are avoidable to talk about at the same time and experience simultaneously. So, those are sort of my main identities that impact my career and my life in general and make me feel, like, underrepresented or marginalized in the industry.

Bryan: I think one of the biggest reasons I felt that I gravitated towards you, Meredith, was understanding your shared experiences. I am a cisgender gay male but we are both queer.

Meredith: I think we both hold multiple identities and we recognize that in each other when we started working together.

Bryan: Exactly.

Meredith: Does that make sense?

Bryan: No, it does.

Meredith: I remember the first meeting and it was a big page term with like a million people there. We were meeting in person for the first time. We'd only been on some calls and we took our first break after many hours of me essentially lecturing the room full of men. And you immediately were just like, "I'm so thrilled with the way you're running this." Like, you gave me a boost. Like, I could tell that you were like, "I see you. I understand that you and I are both in a certain...maybe at a disadvantage in this room and I'm here to amplify you and I'm here to support you." And that turned our relationship in a great way because I didn't really know you, we hadn't communicated very much and it felt immediately like, "Oh, this room is a little bit safer. This room is a little bit more supportive."

Bryan: Exactly.

Meredith: And I think when we do work together, we really try and make sure that that's upheld. And even when we disagree with each other because, you know, we represent different interests sometimes, contract negotiations or whatever, I think we always have that common friendship thread and understanding with each other and empathy with each other. Like, I'm never worried you're talking to me a certain way because of my identities. And I hope you feel the same way with me because we've talked openly about it.

Bryan: When I first met you, I immediately knew that this was a safe space and I was very appreciative that I was meeting someone who could understand my experiences, albeit a little different but we were still there to support each other. And I think that's why I really respect you, Meredith. And I really appreciate all the work we've done. As Meredith has said, we do represent different interests but we have that empathy and that friendship that really gets us going in the right direction. So, I wanna go and dive into some of the challenges you have faced, Meredith. And I wonder if you can talk about what challenge you have faced in the industry because of how you identify. Do you have any experiences that you would like to share?

Meredith: Of course. Do you mind if I give a little bit of context about what specifically I do for anyone who doesn't know to make this make a little bit more sense? So, long story short, I'm a freelancer in live events, experiential branding, experiential events, and design. And I've been in the, like, entertainment industry or events industry for a little over 10 years and I'm still a freelancer. So, the client that I work for that I met Bryan through was called Jack Morton. My department specifically does television but that's also led to a lot of architectural work where we're opening new theaters or new TV studios or new restaurants. Through different clients, I've done all of that kind of stuff.

And I started as a theater person. I came straight out of college. I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do with theater but I knew it was theater. And I am very grateful for my first few years when I sort of didn't know what I was doing and needed money and would take, like, whatever job anyone offered me. So, if you needed theatrical lighting hung, I would do that. That's fine. If you wanted scenic painting down. Sure. Totally down to do that. If you wanted carpentry or box office or whatever, I was willing to do it. And I'm grateful for those years because, you know, eventually I was getting credits as like a master carpenter for a show. On the same season, I was like the assistant stage manager on a different show and I was the company manager for a different festival and doing tours and all these things.

And it just gave me a really holistic view of how events and productions work but also how many people and different personalities and all these different things have to come together. So, I have a long history of being at different levels of power in a room. So, you know, as far as challenges go, the first one off the top of my head is just being misgendered. It's interesting because, you know, my pronouns, I haven't always told people my pronouns were they/them. I didn't even know my pronouns were they/them for a really long time. I was...

Bryan: Oh, interesting.

Meredith: ...lucky. Yeah.

Bryan: I didn't know that.

Meredith: I knew...Oh, this is so hard to describe. So, essentially, I thought everyone else felt the same way about gender that I did and we were all playing, like, a collective game of make-believe. So, like, when I think about my gender identity, it is a void. Like, I don't have a gender identity. I can't relate to any of the things people talk about as far as like really strongly identifying as male or female. It was like an emperor's new clothes kind of thing for me. Like, I was like, "Why are we all pretending this thing matters when we all know it doesn't? This is so weird, this collective societal pretending that we're doing." And I was obviously wrong. I was the outlier.

I was not feeling the same way a lot of other people feel but it took me, you know, making mistakes, and it took me meeting trans people who had such a strong gender identity that they were willing to go through a full transition. They were willing to go through all sorts of errors and obstacles to get to know themselves and really represent who they were. And through those conversations, someone, and I could remember this clear as day because I was explaining, I was like, "I just can't relate. Like, I have no gender identity."

Bryan: Right. You know, something there...right.

Meredith: Like, this doesn't make any sense to me. And that person was just like, "Oh yeah, that sounds like you're a genderqueer. That's what that sounds like." That doesn't sound like someone...

Bryan: A light bulb.

Meredith: ...with binary gender identity. Like, there's a word for that at the time, the word was genderqueer. This is years ago and language has evolved. And so, you know, I kind of started there and did a lot of research and stumbled around and then was lucky. I was working in a lot of weird spaces because of theater. And so some of my friends were like, "Well, let's just try out they/them. Like just us, we'll use it. And if it feels good, we'll keep going with it. And if it doesn't, you'll go back to she/her or whatever you want, go with a neopronoun or whatever." And we tried it out and it felt great. And then I just started, like, opening that sphere more and more. So, like more and more people, I was like welcoming into that sphere. And you know, now I'm in my mid-30s and now it's on my resume and it's like in my email signature.

Bryan: Well, pronouns have become a really important place in our workplace. Even at MGAC, we've rolled out pronouns too because it's such a huge part of one's identity. You know, I'm really happy for you, Meredith, because you resonate this confidence now. There is a confidence to you that speaks in your work but also when you're leading meetings and also personally. And I love hearing these stories about how one comes to accept themselves because I've had a long road as well.

My pronouns are he/him but I wanna learn more about experiences for genderqueer non-binary human beings because I feel like in our industry, we don't meet as many of those individuals. And I think that they are such an important voice that needs to be amplified because a huge part of our community is not being recognized. So, that's why this is so important to me to hear this. And I feel like this is gonna resonate with so many people that are struggling along their journey. And I just wanna commend you on your confidence and finding that voice. I'm gonna go on and on but continue, Meredith.

Meredith: Oh, thank you. I mean, I had to make some real mistakes to get there, whether that was like not understanding and consequently invalidating other people's thoughts about their identity because for a long time, I didn't understand what was going on and I really regret that. And the reason I wanna talk about it and I try to be open about it is because I want people to have the right words and the right understanding that I didn't have until I was in my 20s. I'm so excited for Gen Z and Gen Alpha to already have the words.

Bryan: And people like us really to help support them.

Meredith: Yeah. And I think the fact that my biggest corporate client has pronouns in their email signature like in their brand guidelines, your email signature is dictated. So like what font it is, what color, like it's a corporate rollout of what the pronouns are and they changed it within the last couple of years to include pronouns. And then next to it is like a little link that says, "What's this?" And you click on that and on their website is like a section you can go to saying like why they think pronouns are important. And that's huge. I feel like we got off the original question.

Bryan: You were talking about giving context about who you are as a person.

Meredith: Yeah.

Bryan: And the challenges that you have faced in the industry.

Meredith: So, here's a good example of challenges then. Obviously, the most common microaggression for me is being misgendered and it used to be all the time but not everyone knew my actual pronouns. And in some ways, that was better. Like, there was definitely a time in my life where if I knew you personally and you knew my pronouns, but it wasn't in my email signature and people made assumptions and used whatever pronouns, and I couldn't be upset with anyone because they didn't know. Now it's in my email signature, it's on my resume. Other people refer to me by my correct pronouns. And then if someone is using my incorrect pronouns, like really consistently without ever correcting themselves, then it's like a choice. It's somehow in some ways worse with certain people because now I'm like, oh, okay. Like, you are now actively making a choice.

Bryan: You're aware.

Meredith: You're aware. You definitely know. You've probably had to go to some sort of DEI training in the last few years to talk to you about this. Most companies have something required like that and you're still making this choice and that can make it worse.

Bryan: Have you ever had to explain that to someone? I know that I catch myself with pronouns but I always make a cognizant effort in my head and personally because it's so important to me that I always use the correct pronouns when I'm speaking to anyone whose pronouns are different from, you know, the gender that I physically see or I am associating that in a way.

Meredith: Yeah. Your gender assumptions. Is that what...

Bryan: Exactly. You know, as you talk about that challenge, have you ever had to physically, or not physically, ever, you know, talk to them about...?

Meredith: Did I shake someone? No.

Bryan: That's exactly what you have to do.

Meredith: Yeah. I just shake them until they get it right. No. I have definitely said things to people before like, "Hey, you know my pronouns. I know you know them because sometimes you get them right. And sometimes you purposely don't or if not purposefully, then you are choosing in the moment to, like, prioritize your comfort over my comfort and safety." So, for instance, I've had clients in the past who are pretty good about using my pronouns when we're talking and interacting, but then when we're talking to higher-up or we're talking to the exterior client or whatever, all of a sudden all of that's gone because they don't wanna have to explain why they're using they/them pronouns for me.

That's an interesting thing that I've noticed where people to my face will use the right pronouns but then in an email to someone else will misgender me, which almost takes more work because you're like typing it out and proofing your own email, or in a call to clients will misgender me. But if it was an internal call, they would be correct. They would do the right thing. But in an external call, they don't.

Bryan: That's almost painful to hear, especially being kind of one of those external clients on projects for yourself, Meredith. I know that when I'm communicating to others if we are speaking about our project, I always intend to use the correct pronouns, even if you're not in the conversation, emails, whatnot.

Meredith: Yeah. No. And I see you like...

Bryan: Because it's a matter of respect.

Meredith: Yeah. You correct people like in big meetings. You'll be like, "They/them," which I super appreciate because not everyone does that. I always say that's like the first thing you can do as being a good coworker or good ally, however you wanna describe it.

Bryan: Exactly.

Meredith: Just casually correct people. The only way people will get good at pronouns that they aren't used to or are changing for someone is if they practice. The best way for that to happen is when someone is talking about me and I'm not around and everyone is holding each other accountable. So, like, if people are having a meeting that I'm mentioned in but I'm not actually present in, if everyone can hold each other accountable there, it'll get so much easier in every other meeting. Actually, I got married this last year and my...

Bryan: Congratulations. Yes.

Meredith: Thank you. My husband, leading up to the wedding, we were talking about what we wanted and one of the things I wanted was to be misgendered as little as possible throughout the day. And it's hard because it's the wedding industrial complex and, you know, there's all these vendors who don't really know you and a million caterers and all these people. So, I knew it wasn't possible to totally have, like, a day where no one said bride to me or whatever. Like, I set my expectations reasonably but we did make a point of really talking to all of our extended family and our close friends and making sure that one could hold up that into the bargain, essentially. We were like, "Hey, some of you have known us for a really long time." And it's a wedding, there are people I didn't know very well that were there as well.

Bryan: As always. It always happens. It always happens.

Meredith: Like, the extended family and like significant others of people I haven't seen since college and whatever, you know. So, we had a lot of conversations with different people. And one of the things that I really, like, touched by is one of the people I thought would have a real problem with it just came back and was like, "What's the etiquette? I'll do whatever. Like, I want Meredith to be happy. I just wanna know what the etiquette is."

And it was someone that I thought had had a relatively conservative upbringing, worked in a pretty conservative industry. And he just wanted to know the rules. So, essentially, we like, made up a little script for him that was like, "Hi, my name is X. And my pronouns are he/him." I was like, "That's your introduction now. Like, you introduce yourself that way. And then that invites the other person to give you their pronouns. And then if everyone does that, you never have to worry that you don't know someone's pronouns."
I think that is so important. And that's something that I think is important in industry things because one of the things that I've said to people is like, at this point in my life, I don't mind having my pronouns in my email signature. It's fine. But don't ask me to out myself to every single person that I interact with if you are not gonna hold yourself to the same standard of supporting me in those situations. Because almost all my clients now that's their standard email signature.

And for years now, that's been like happening more and more. And it started with my, like, cabaret clients, my theater clients. Now, the fact that with my most corporate clients too is wonderful. In the same wave, I've watched this question sweep that if you are going to do introductions where everyone has to state their pronoun, or it's gonna be email signatures, or like whatever the thing is, there's gonna be an upside and a downside to that. And if you are going to institute that at your organization, then you have to be prepared to support the person if they need it later.

Bryan: And again, it always comes back to accountability. If you're rolling out these guidelines, you're rolling out these processes, these policies really at the end of the day, we have to hold the company accountable, these individuals accountable. I think that our collective queer group has lived in an era of being marginalized for too long. I've sometimes felt so uncomfortable to be who I am as a person, which is unfair to us. So, now it's the time, especially as corporate companies are rolling out these policies, it's time to hold them accountable because they're presenting themselves as being ready and that's what we need to do. So, I completely agree with you, Meredith. Have you ever had to, you know, adapt who you are in the workplace maybe earlier in your career or...?

Meredith: Every day. Today. I had other video calls today. And I sat and stared at how much makeup I was gonna wear, what shirt I was gonna put on. I was meeting some new people today. Is like presenting more fem or more masculine gonna serve me better in those particular interactions? It's a million decisions all the time. And like, if I'm going to a construction site, sometimes I'm on a construction site, then, same thing. Will I be treated better or worse if I present more fem that day? It doesn't really matter. Like, I have a pretty flexible gender presentation. And so some days I wanna dress more masculine and some days I wanna dress more fem. And like, some days I wanna wear lipstick and some days I don't, whatever the thing is, and I have to weigh all of those decisions really carefully.

Bryan: It's interesting how our society's standards of beauty are really ingrained in our heads and that we understand that how we present ourselves is going to impact how others perceive us and how they, you know, interact with us. So, I think I've talked about this with other guests on my podcast, especially Black women. I'm happy that you're sharing this experience because I think people need to hear this experience that it's unfair to us to have this idea of discomfort and trying to wash it away by trying to present ourselves in a different manner that's not really who we are.

Meredith: Yeah. And I'm lucky. Like, I'm like a relatively conventionally attractive white fem. I have lucked out in a lot of ways and there's less weight in the way I present myself than there would be for a Black woman, for instance. Like there's decisions that are easy for me that will have minimal impact, and I'm very grateful for that. But at the same time, there are decisions that are hard and have impact and have gone well and gone poorly. And now I'm pretty good about reading what people wanna see and then presenting that or, like, riding the line pretty well. But it took a long time to find that.

And you asked if I've ever felt unsafe? And like absolutely, 100%. It doesn't happen super often anymore. It's been a long time since I felt like physically unsafe on a job with regularity but it used to be very, very common. And I've been sexually harassed a lot in my career and it only really stopped because I was gaining power in every room that I walked into. And I'm very of the fact that what transitioned was that I was in charge and not that people stopped being terrible. Like, the consequences of being terrible to me became greater for them, but that's the only transition.

And so I really try in the rooms where I have any sort of control...because not every job do I get to hire the crew or have any impact on that sort of thing. But when I do have some influence, I try very hard to make sure that I'm creating a room that 21-year-old me could have walked into and been safe and felt safe. And I do think that that comes from the top down. And so, like, there are TV studios that are my favorite TV studios to work in because no one has ever hit on me in them. No one has ever called me honey or sweetie, or like any of those little microaggressions. I get that all the time still.

Bryan: That language.

Meredith Dear is one that weirdly drives me insane. But like, those little things, there are certain studios, and it doesn't matter who's filming in that studio or whatever the thing is, no one ever says anything like that to me. And it's because the leadership of the crew does not allow that atmosphere to brew in that location. And then there's the opposite of that as well. There are TV studios that I'm like, "Ugh, it doesn't matter, like, what show is filming in that studio, I know what that crew feels to be around and it's gonna be a hard one." You know, like, it's maybe not me getting hit on but just like a general lack of respect. I have to kind of prove myself more kinda thing.

Bryan: And I think as we move forward as an industry, that's exactly what we need to be doing. We need to harbor that safe atmosphere. I've noticed the same thing, Meredith, as I've gained "more power," I have felt more safe, you know, presenting myself as a person. So, that resonates with me and the language, I've never experienced dear, honey, but I've seen it happen. And, you know, when I was younger, it was these older white men speaking to these women. Because I was younger in my career, I didn't know what to say but in my head, I'd always go to whoever it was and be like, "Are you okay?" Because those microaggressions are not okay. And typically, when I spoke to those individuals, they'd say, "I've experienced it a lot but now I know how to deal with it." Because, you know, when I was younger, when I was 22, 23, I questioned, "Is it my place to say something right now, or am I going to get reprimanded from this higher-up?" I didn't know how to navigate that situation.

Meredith: Well, it's interesting how it, like, trains you too. So, I used to put up with that a lot at work. It was really hard. It was like a thing that I dealt with all the time. I would purposely dress very masculine and never wear makeup in front of anyone I worked with at certain locations to minimize it as much as possible, which increased harassment in some ways, but like decreased sexual...You know, like, I used to have to make a lot of really tough decisions just in getting dressed in the morning, much less who I ate lunch with and who I was alone in rooms with and all those things.

But, you know, a lot of that has gotten better. And then last year I actually got hit on pretty aggressively on a job site and it built up over a few weeks and I didn't really know the person, they weren't on my crew. They weren't like a direct report to me. I didn't know who their direct report was but it happened enough. And it was amazing how quickly when it finally crossed over from being like, hmm, this guy's like a little too chatty to me to like him saying inappropriate things very quickly to me. I was just like, oh, I was so surprised, and how quickly I felt young and helpless again.

Like, how fast all that power that I felt like I had built up and had protected me in a lot of ways disappeared. And that's from years of being powerless in those situations. You know, when I was really young, I, like, didn't know how to report things. And then I think one of the problems with, especially, like, the starter theater industry, like when I was really young, I was doing essentially, like, very low-budget theater shows to regional theater maybe to off-Broadway kind of stuff.

And there wasn't a structure for who to report things to because the company is so small. It's, like, scrappy. It's probably nonprofit. There's not like a single accounts payable person, much less an HR person. Everyone's wearing like 50 hats and you just don't know who to go to. And I think that that is part of the problem that the leadership doesn't make it clear like who we go to and who you could trust to talk about those things.

And that's something I think is important now as we move forward as an industry is making sure that there's like a clear, who do you go to if something happens? What's the process? Where can someone go? Because it's so jarring when it happens and to have a structure in place so that I don't have to wonder who I go to or think about it or send a couple of tentative emails to try and figure out who I would talk to about it. Taking those decisions out of the equation so I know exactly what to do is such a helpful thing you can do to make a safe work environment.

Bryan: You know, it's interesting because when those incidents do happen, I think I sometimes get lost, especially in the moment you're, like, thinking, "Whoa, well, what just happened?" And you said, you feel powerless. I start to question myself and that's the worst part about it because then at that point it's like, wow, you really have lost your power. And you've given power to this other individual who doesn't deserve that power. And you think, "Is this worth reporting to? Does this make me seem weak?"

And at those times, I think now, as you said, there are reporting structures in our companies but I still sometimes feel like I don't wanna lose myself in those situations and panic and start to question myself and lose my confidence in my abilities to protect myself, and also, at the end of the day, to protect others so that it doesn't happen again. How can we move past this discrimination and really focus on a better industry? Which you've already touched upon now.

Meredith: Yeah. I have such a strong belief in good leadership. I've worked in departments where the leadership was great. I've worked in departments where the leadership was lacking and that is really the difference. Like, all the talent in the world can be there, all the resources can be there, and it really comes down to leadership and having someone who is willing to acknowledge they need to change, is willing to acknowledge they need to grow, and is willing to prioritize it. And like I was saying, like, everyone's been to a DEI training or a DEI event in the last couple of years probably. Right?

Bryan: Right.

Meredith: If I show up to one of those that a company I'm working with is...Like, if I get an email about a speaker series or, like, whatever the thing is, and I show up to it and not a single person in leadership is on that call, I know exactly what they prioritize. Like, in that moment, they've prioritized making it appear like they care about DEI by paying for a speaker or organizing an event. But if they haven't, like, heavily publicized it to the people that work with them, if they haven't encouraged people where they can bill that time...because I know a lot of people if they have unbillable hours, they don't get paid for those hours or if they have unbillable hours, they feel the pressure to not attend that training. You know, like, give people a job number to bill it to, remind people about it, encourage people to attend, and then have your leadership in those meetings. And make it so clear that it's important for everyone to be there.

Bryan: It really does start with leadership recognizing all of that and really being involved.

Meredith: And it can be so good. I recently did an interview. One of my employers had me do an interview for national pronouns day and I did it and they published it on their blog, you know. And then it was like sent to the whole company, which was wonderful and terrifying. And the president of that company, like the North American president of that company, immediately sent me an email after reading it and was like, "Thank you so much for doing this. I realized probably in some of our interactions, I've misgendered you and I am so sorry." In that article that they had written from talking to me, I had recommended people just increase what they're exposed to. Like, we all have a limitation, whoever our friend group is, whatever it is. Follow people on social media you would never have followed otherwise. Do whatever it is to increase the spectrum of the world that you see.

Bryan: Don't live in a bubble.

Meredith: Don't live in a bubble and, like, make yourself hear about different experiences. And I do the same thing. Mine have gotten increasingly radical that I follow over years to, like, keep pushing myself. But I think that's the only way. And, yeah, like, this person who had I'm sure a million things to be doing then had an email exchange with me about what social media I recommended and he immediately started following all of them, and it...

Bryan: That's great.

Meredith: ...was amazing to feel, not only had he taken the time to read the thing, which I'm sure a lot of other people did not, he took it to heart. He apologized for what had happened in the past. We hadn't worked together a lot but we had, like, been in meetings together. He acknowledged that he had probably messed up and immediately took ownership of it, said he wanted to do better, and then took steps. And that's all you can ask of anyone...

Bryan: Yeah, it is.

Meredith: ...is to, like, acknowledge what they've done, apologize for it, and then do better in the future.

Bryan: That's emotional and mental maturity that we are all seeking from our colleagues.

Meredith: I was blown away by that.

Bryan: I love that. You know, I always hope that when we're creating these safe spaces, and say there is a microaggression or treatment that is that you wanna report to, I always have this hope that the person that you're...an HR is understanding and is going to be supportive because I know that there are probably teams across this country that you'll report to HR and they'll be dismissive. And that's probably one of the worst things that that person could face because then that continues to marginalize the group and also creates an uncomfortable and really not a safe space. So, that's one of my biggest concerns and hope that HR creates that safe space and that individual who is in that position.

I know that we've been talking about behavior and discrimination and just our shared experiences but I wanna move on to the...and we've already kind of touched upon this, Meredith, but the advantages of diversity and why you're such a strong asset to the team. You know, can you elaborate why DEI is so important in the workplace? We've already touched on a few of the topics. To our listeners, I don't even have to tell you why Meredith is a strong asset to your team. They need to be hired and be on that project team. This is the 18th...

Meredith Find me on LinkedIn. Yeah. I mean, I just think unregimented thinking, or like, a lack of boundaries in your thinking is valuable and nothing important or beautiful or groundbreaking has happened because people weren't pushing boundaries and thinking outside of their lived experience and pushing past their lived experience to that date. And I think having to live that every single day also makes me good at bringing that into creative brainstorming sessions or how I think about a budget or whatever the thing is. Like, I'm just not as binary in my thinking because nothing in my life is a binary. And I find that that's really important. One of the pieces of feedback I get a lot that I'm very proud of is that I create a good environment to work in and that I can turn a very tense team into a team that really gets along.

Bryan: I agree with that.

Meredith: Thank you. And like wants to have that weekly meeting. Wants a little fun in the week or whatever the thing is. And I don't know if you can find that everywhere. I know that that's something unique that I bring to the table that I can make people like each other by finding out little things about people, like bringing personality to the table. And that is a skill I learned through my experiences of being marginalized.

Bryan: That's a skill that I definitely value of you, Meredith. Especially in our meetings, you have been able to really create that rapport with others, especially in this digital age with COVID. When we all had to jump on the Zoom, the dreaded Zoom call, you and Larry were great at bringing that personality to the table. And that's a great skill that I also have to commend you on. Really, we have to speak through Zoom and we're doing this through Zoom right now but it shines through the computer and that's one of the most important qualities to have. I thank you for that.

Meredith: Thank you for saying that because it's a skill that I feel like I didn't always have, and I worked really hard to create a welcoming environment.

Bryan: It's a skill I'm working on too. So, I'm learning from you.

Meredith: Oh, thank you. Yeah. And that's like the dream, that everyone that I work with tries to create a more welcoming environment because they experienced a welcoming environment. And like, I had someone who did that for me, I'm hoping that I can do that for other people. And, you know, you were asking what diversity brings to the table, why people should pursue it. And I would say, like, a lot of it is just like, it's the ethical choice. Like, you should just do it because it's the right thing to do. But if people are trying to make, like, an economic argument for it, I would also just say, like, why would you bring five people into a room that have all had the same experiences and the same education?
They've all followed the same path and you're trying to forge a new path, wouldn't you want someone in the room that has different experiences and different education and different artistic influences and all of these different things? Because maybe, you know...this metaphor might be getting a little too intense. But like, let's say the new path you're trying to forge has to go over water. And like, all of you are from a desert. Like, you don't know how to deal with water. You need to bring someone in with, like, a little bit more information and you can't do that if everyone has the same background and the same experiences.

Bryan: Exactly.

Meredith: To me, that's just like so logical, like, why would you want a group of people that are all the same? And I don't know if that's because I come from specifically, like, a theater background that was very heavy in, like, ensemble work and collaborative creation of work. So, like, the whole room of people created a theater piece, not an individual was a writer, and an individual was a designer, and an individual was an actor. So to me, it's like, "Oh, everyone should be collaborative. Everyone's on equal footing here." It just makes a lot of sense to me. And so I'm always a little taken aback when I feel like...you're asking because you want people to hear the answer to that question. But sometimes people ask me that question with like a real, "Why would I bother to do that?" And I'm just like, "Because it's the most logical thing in the world."

Bryan: That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to expand the horizons for a lot of individuals. And that's why I wanna harness this platform to create that visibility, you know, to amplify our voices because, you know, our identities, your identity, your background experiences brings a lot to the table and it should not be dismissed. It should be heard. And so, I think this is a powerful way to harness that. So, we've talked about how, when we were younger, we had faced, you know, discrimination and where do we go to report something? What advice would you give to young people pursuing careers in our industry who are worried about facing similar discrimination? What would you say to them?

Meredith: I would tell them to find the people that are making the work that makes you excited and to find a mentor. I think mentorship is really important in the industry, and it never hurts to email and just ask if you can buy them coffee and have like an informational interview or a Zoom interview, I think that's really important. And I also think my advice to non-young people in the industry is to always say yes to doing those coffees and to those Zooms because that is how doors get opened.

And I would say it's changing and it's getting better. And there's a lot of us out there trying to reach our hands back for you, and to know that we're out there. And also, at the same time, that's not true at every single company and it's okay to not wanna work somewhere because it's not a good environment. There is a good environment out there for you if you can find it. But it may not be as easy as it should be. And I'm very, very sorry for that. But please know that there's a lot of people who are rooting for you and if you can find us, we're building a better world, or we're trying to, as we move forward.

Bryan: Where do you think that our industry will be in 10 years' time?

Meredith: I hope very environmentally friendly. I hope willing to set aside the way we've always done it or the way we should have been doing it. Not just setting aside things to set them aside, but really reprioritizing and thinking about what's the most important? What do we have to keep? What should we keep? And I feel like there's a lot of change coming with climate change, with the economy, with a potential for continued pandemics, and how we handle all of that.

I hope that we keep the good and are willing to let go of the mediocre and bad and rebuild. So, I think that that's coming, I'm seeing it. I'm seeing a lot of good change. I'm really interested to see the innovation that's going on. I'm really interested in the changes in, like, hiring practices that I'm seeing and sexual harassment training that I'm seeing, but we have a ton of work to do, you know.

Bryan: Yeah. I see it too. So, hopefully, in 10 years' time, we can revisit this podcast and have a conversation. Especially because I think at that point we may have greater power to create these safe spaces that we're talking about. At that point, I think that companies should all be a safe space for anyone.

Meredith: I would just love to be in fewer meetings where I am the only non-man. The majority of my meetings, it is just me or it is me and maybe one or two other people. And that can wear you down over time.

Bryan: Oh, it does. There was a picture on LinkedIn the other day of a construction group receiving an award, or it was an engineering group. I think it was like 12 people and there were all white men. And I just thought to myself, "What? I can't understand how they're just...Where's the woman? Where's the diversity? There's nothing there." I don't know. I mean, sure, the structure is great but I hope in 10 years' time that is not the same photo, you know.

Meredith: Sometimes I joke that, like I walk into a new meeting and I see another fem or someone who's, like, gender presentation isn't totally binary, and I get excited like a dog gets excited when they see another dog in, like, a park. And I'm just like, "Oh my God, hi. Hi." Because it's so rare. Not to say that every single meeting but it's a lot of meetings where it's just me and I would love for that to change. I get so excited to work with people of different backgrounds. And like, I'm white. So, sometimes it's still a room full of white people and only white people. And that also makes me very sad because at what point is it a choice? And I have to, like, have that thought in the back of my head like, "At what point was this the choice that was made?" How old can your company be and be entirely white men before? I'm like, "Oh, well that's the company you built."

You know like, that's a valid question to have out there, especially now, you know, like there's more college-educated women than there are men. There's the, like, demographics of, you know, the argument of like, "Well, I couldn't find some binders full of women." I don't know if you remember that. I feel like you're younger than me. And I don't know if you remember the binders full of women, like, debacle at one point. But essentially someone was like, "Why aren't there any women that work at your company?" And he was like, "I have binders full of women applicants to work for me. I just haven't found the right one."

Bryan: Excuse me? I've never heard that before.

Meredith: I think it's from a presidential debate. And like, that argument just doesn't apply. Like, there are people qualified in whatever industry it is that are of different backgrounds than like, white, straight, cis men.

Bryan: Exactly.

Meredith: You could have that diversity on your team and you have maybe chosen not to. And I think a part of that is hiring. You know, like if you went to Yale and you keep hiring through your alumni network, that's gonna limit what is available to you. Yeah. Economically, like, race, gender, like, it's all gonna limit you. And so I think there's a way things have been done for a long time where it's like, "Oh, well, whenever I need someone, I just email this person and they tell me whoever the recent graduates are." Like, whatever the thing is. You can't do that anymore. You have to make a little bit more effort. You have to make this a little bit more effort.

Bryan: Exactly. Meredith, I truly appreciate this conversation. You are one of a kind. Anyone listening, you must have Meredith on your team. There's no one else like you, Meredith, and I've been so grateful and blessed to have worked alongside you on our projects and that we're continuing to work through. And you create amazing designs. And so I hope that anyone listening here, if they ever wanna reach out to me or you, I hope they feel comfortable doing so. And we're here to be supporters and also just listen and be an open book for everyone. That's the purpose of this podcast, to really ensure the people feel safe. And I really thank you for that, Meredith, allowing me the opportunity to speak with you. Your voice is amazing and I'm happy that you agreed to speak with me.

Meredith: I'm honored to have been invited to be on here and for you to think that this conversation needed to be out towards other people. We've had conversations like this privately, and I'm just so proud of you for creating a platform and using your power for good, essentially. So, thank you, Bryan. You're part of what's gonna change the industry and I'm honored to have any small part in it. So, I hope you have just the best day and I'm sure we'll have 9 million meetings together soon.

Bryan: Thank you, Meredith.

Meredith: You make my day brighter whenever I get a chance to speak to you. And thank you for all that you're doing.

Bryan: Thank you. Well, with that, everyone, thank you for listening to this episode of "MGAC Inner Voices" with our first external consultant, Meredith Sonnen. Check back next month for our next episode. Bye, everyone.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Over the years, we have been enlisted to work on so many of these once-in-a-lifetime projects—work that has shaped skylines, pushed the boundaries of the built environment, and brought communities closer together. Every new ask is just as exciting as the first, and we are forever humbled by the opportunity we have to leave our small mark on the world around us. For us, this is the kind of work that never gets old, and we are immensely proud of our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>project portfolio</strong></a>.

Behind every one of these successful deliveries is an exceptional team we are proud to call our own, a network of partners we are fortunate to call friends, and a growing base of the best clients we could ask for—those that dream big, dare to do something new, and believe in more than brick and mortar. There are a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between Day One and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. Because it is in those moments that we carve away at challenges and the impossible moves closer in reach.

In our new monthly blog series, we will revisit these very moments as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. We look forward to having you here with us as we go <strong>Behind the Build</strong>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following last year’s win as a Top Workplace in the greater <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-recognized-as-top-workplace-in-the-washington-posts-annual-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, DC</a> area and multiple awards for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-recognized-in-october-2021-top-workplaces-national-culture-excellence-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Excellence</a>, MGAC is humbled to be recognized as a 2022 Top Workplaces USA National Award recipient!

Over the past year, <a href="https://www.energage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energage</a>, an employee engagement firm, has invited nearly 42,000 organizations to compete for the national awards, which include Top Workplaces USA, Industry specific awards, and quarterly Culture Excellence awards. On average, fewer than 3% of eligible organizations earn a Top Workplaces designation, making these achievements clear differentiators among peers.

The USA program is open to all organizations that have at least 150 employees in the United States. Energage took the survey results and compared them to similar sized organizations nationwide to determine a minimum threshold to be eligible for consideration. Based on the scores from the survey, Energage created a proprietary evaluation system and recognized organizations over a specific threshold. MGAC has been recognized as a winner in the 150-499 employee size band.

Many thanks go to our team for their enduring dedication and commitment to the firm, and for their contributions towards making MGAC a top place to work. Congratulations to all!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we are happy to announce the addition of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/brett-leffler/103" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Brett Leffler</strong></a> to our leadership team as MGAC’s new Chief Financial Officer. In this role, Brett will be responsible for overseeing and driving enhancements in the company’s financial activities, while empowering leaders at MGAC to grow across sectors and services.

Brett comes to MGAC with more than 18 years of financial expertise with experience leading teams at both non-profit and for-profit companies across a multitude of industries. Most recently, and for the past 8 years, he worked for Enterprise Community Partners, a real estate industry non-profit dedicated to increasing housing supply for families experiencing homelessness, as the organization’s Vice President of Finance. Brett is a certified public accountant and received his Master of Business Administration from Georgetown University and his Bachelor of Science in Accounting from the University of Maryland, College Park. Currently, he is pursuing an Executive Certificate in Leadership from Harvard University.

“We are thrilled to welcome Brett to MGAC,” <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/mark-anderson/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mark Anderson</strong></a>, Founder and President of MGAC, says. “It is an exciting moment for us as a company. We are growing—and busier than ever—and it will be key to have Brett’s help in defining this next chapter for our team. More compelling than his list of accolades is the way he describes himself as a change agent with soft skills; an individual with a consultative approach to bring about progress. His expertise, and most importantly his ethos, make him a tremendous addition to our leadership team.”

“I am excited to join an organization whose employees are so passionate about the work they do and the clients they serve,” Brett says. “Everyone I have met with so far has exuded such a passion for their work and their desire to continue to see MGAC grow. It makes me want to jump right on board and get started!”

When he is not working, Brett can be found spending time with his wife and two young daughter’s at their home in Potomac, Maryland, traveling to new and exciting places with his family, or enjoying a round of golf with friends. Next up on his travel docket is a trip to the fairways and greens of Scotland in 2023.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">Sourced from <a href="https://www.world-architects.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>World-Architects</em></a></h6>
<h6 class="sfnewsAuthorAndDate">01.02.2022</h6>
The transformation of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, DC, has received the most votes in our poll for US Building of the Year, which focused on adaptive reuse and renovation projects in 2021. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the 1972 library was renovated by Mecanoo and OTJ Architects.

Writing in 2012 in their updated critical biography of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Mies biographer Franz Schulze and architect Edward Windhorst describe the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library as "little loved by patrons and critics" and "currently under threat of replacement." It was Mies's only public library and his only building in Washington, DC, though he would not see it completed, having died in 1969 in Chicago. The budget was low, as Schulze and Windhorst point out, resulting in deep and "unrelenting" floor plates, "no special spaces or interior sequences," and "no sense of quality," especially compared to other Mies buildings. Though far from a masterpiece, they considered it "structurally sound and readily adaptable," endorsing a "sensitive revitalization."

The following year, in 2013, the path to revitalization began, with the District of Columbia Public Library (DCPL) launching an international architectural competition to reimagine the library that was designed by Mies and named for civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. (The latter happened when DC residents successfully organized a letter-writing campaign to name the District's new central library after King following his assassination in 1968.) In February 2014, the Dutch firm Mecanoo and DC's Martinez+Johnson, which subsequently merged with OTJ Architects, won the invited competition.

Ever since their design of the grass-covered library at Delft University of Technology was completed in 1997, Mecanoo has been a go-to firm for libraries. They have realized a number of new buildings for libraries, such as the <a href="https://www.world-architects.com/en/mecanoo-delft/project/library-of-birmingham">Library of Birmingham</a> (2013) and <a href="https://www.world-architects.com/en/mecanoo-delft/project/tainan-public-library">Tainan Public Library</a> (2021), but just as many renovations appear to be occupying their time as of late, as with the the <a href="https://www.world-architects.com/en/mecanoo-delft/project/stavros-niarchos-foundation-library">Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library</a>, a large branch of the New York Public Library that opened last year, and the library's historic research building across the street. Needless to say, Mecanoo and OTJ were an excellent choice for renovating DC's central library in a way that would respect the existing building but make it more functional — and beautiful — as a 21st-century library.

Following three years of construction, the rejuvenated Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library opened to the public in September 2020 — the transformation was described as "miraculous" by a local critic ahead of its opening — and in February 2021 <a href="https://www.american-architects.com/en/architecture-news/reviews/martin-luther-king-jr-memorial-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we featured it as a US Building of the Week</a> between other adaptive reuse and renovation projects. From the exterior the library is still unmistakably Mies, with its curtain wall with dark glass and frames, expressed I-beam mullions, and recessed ground floor; even a new pavilion on the roof is set back so as to not be visible from the street. New features on the inside, including two wood-lined stairs and a 291-seat auditorium at the top of the building, are fluid foils to Mies's grid-based, orthogonal architecture. Artwork in the lobby and grand reading room, formerly a single-height space, add color to the interior spaces while also celebrating the life of Dr. King.

Francine Houben, principal, founding partner, and creative director of Mecanoo, illuminates the goals of their design: "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library reconciles the Mies building, the values of Martin Luther King, and what the library of the future must be. We have made the MLKL more organic, more transparent and more open, both physically and in how it reaches out to Washington, DC. Like never before, this great library extends its welcome to all communities, across all ages and backgrounds, and gives them the resources to build better lives."

Upon hearing the news that readers voted the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library above the dozens of other Buildings of the Week, Mecanoo sent us a brief message: "We are very happy with such recognition from the World-Architects readers. Adaptive reuse and transformation is a field within architecture that is getting more attention and recognition. It is not just about restoration or renovation; it’s about bringing new life into buildings that once served a purpose and need to be transformed in order to serve their communities. Therefore we must be prepared for (un)predictable change."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, our Seattle team spent the afternoon volunteering at <a href="https://foodlifeline.org/">Food Lifeline</a>’s South Seattle warehouse. Under the watchful eye and guidance of Kevin, our host from Food Lifeline, and with hit tunes from the 80’s and 90’s pumping overhead, the team found it’s groove<em>—</em>sorting, packing, hefting, palettizing, and shrink-wrapping over 5,700 pounds of food and beverage<em>—</em>all destined for distribution to families facing hunger throughout Western Washington.

MGAC's Seattle team enjoyed working together to make a difference in the community! Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalestern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dale Stern</a> for doing the research, finding Food Lifeline, and coordinating all the arrangements necessary to make the effort a success!

<em>Food Lifeline is on a mission to end hunger in Western Washington. They believe that access to food is a human right and that nobody deserves to be hungry. Food Lifeline provides nutritious food to hundreds of thousands of people facing hunger every year by sourcing nutritious food from a variety of food industry partners. They distribute this food through a partnership with 350 food banks, shelters, and meal programs, enabling them to provide the equivalent of more than 201,000 meals every single day. At the same time, they are working to end hunger for the future by addressing its root causes, including systemic inequity and social injustice. They do this through advocacy efforts to shape local, state, and federal policy, by partnering with organizations that are addressing other causes of poverty, and through community engagement and mobilization efforts.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Getting there is a matter of a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between day one and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. We are revisiting them as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. Today, we go <strong>Behind the Build</strong> and revisit our work with the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Core Science Facility. </em>

In 2015, MGAC was enlisted to work on an exciting and ambitious project for the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a> (MUN): <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/memorial-university-of-newfoundland/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $325M Core Science Facility on MUN’s St. John’s campus.</a> Designed to channel the University’s unique sense of place with its <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mun-core-science-facility-csf-design-inspired-icebergs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iceberg-inspired structure</a>, house both science and engineering faculty, and attract top-tier faculty and students, the immense opportunity was clear. So, too, were the challenges: the project site was a three-hour flight from our Toronto office and situated on the North Atlantic, one of the most notoriously inhospitable and unexpected weather climates. But we knew our people were ready for it, and immediately got underway plotting how we would make it happen.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>THE RIGHT PEOPLE, BACKED BY A DIVERSE FIRM</strong></h4>
Given those challenges, it was clear it would require a full-time project manager on-site. We recognized that reality and promptly made arrangements for <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-on-the-move-memorial-university-of-newfoundland-core-science-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senior Project Manager Sam Hakemi</a> and his family to relocate to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. And he hit the ground running.

Still, even with the perfect team on the ground and planning in place, unexpected challenges are inevitable in our line of work. And indeed, throughout the course of this project, we would encounter everything from a shortage of qualified tradespeople from the jump to the installation of a gargantuan whale skeleton. Our ability to navigate each challenge had everything to do with our people—those in the immediate project team and those who work across different disciplines, sectors, and MGAC offices across North America. Over the years, that talented team and the ability to tap into a wide-ranging collective knowledge base would make this ambitious project possible.

&nbsp;

<h4><strong>ANYTHING BUT COOKIE-CUTTER </strong></h4>
Our first obstacle surfaced before work even got underway. We knew this complex laboratory project would require hyper-specialized workers. After all, putting together a building with two nitrogen plants—amongst many other complicated systems—isn’t exactly your run-of-the-mill construction job. What we didn’t know—but quickly learned—was how scarce the area was with such specialized tradespeople. And, with MUN a public University beholden to strict procurement guidelines, we were unable to seek workers outside the traditional bidding framework. We knew we had to find another way. We needed to revisit the project with fresh eyes to develop the best procurement strategy to initiate the work.

Over a 10-month period, we revisited each and every aspect of the project plan. In deep discussions with our client, we vetted removal recommendations from the architect and engineer. It’s easy to shave the cost of a laboratory project on the surface—cut a nitrogen plant here, reduce the purity level there—but making these decisions without due diligence can result in a project nightmare. Through clear and concise discussion and diligent follow-up with all parties, we established alternative approaches to get work done. This would be the first of many instances where our team, a group of talented professionals that are anything but cookie-cutter in their approach, would write and rewrite the script for project management. That flexibility and willingness to go above and beyond set the tone and the bar for the project.

<h4><strong>THINKING ONE STEP AHEAD</strong></h4>
Those who have followed this project might be familiar with one of its more storied aspects: the inspiring (and impossible to miss) <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/blue-whale-arrives-at-muns-core-science-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue whale skeleton</a> that hangs in its atrium. While not part of our original project scope, when the opportunity arose for MUN to procure a blue whale for display in the new Core Science Facility, the team was immediately interested. But how would they transport the massive body of a blue whale 3,000 kilometers, prepare it for installation, and suspend it 100 feet up in the air? They weren’t exactly sure where to begin.

That’s where we stepped in. Recognizing that this task was not so different from the museum installations MGAC’s <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/sectors/cultural" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cultural</a> team routinely oversees, Hakemi put in a call to his colleagues. Their expert input was the map the project team needed to navigate the necessary steps to follow.

After a three-day road trip across eastern Canada packed in specially-designed containers that expedited its decomposition, the whale arrived. The skeleton then underwent a chemical process to remove remaining collagen which ends up bleaching the bones. From there, the bones were dyed back to their natural coloration—something Hakemi learned about when he enlisted the input of a marine biologist to provide color samples for the skeleton’s accurate hue and recommendations for realistic poses for its display. Now…to get it installed.

With a background in architecture, Hakemi knew this install needed an engineer’s stamp of approval. After all, the structural integrity of a gargantuan skeleton that people pass beneath daily is not something to take lightly. After engaging two engineers, he commissioned a 3D model of the skeleton that detailed precisely where and how rigging lines would be installed—circumnavigating pipes, vents, and support beams. Come install day, assembly was as simple as connecting the dots.

<h4><strong>PART PROJECT MANAGER, PART AMBASSADOR</strong></h4>
The Core Science Facility was a big project in every sense of the word. At 480,000 SF and with its 200-plus tradespeople on site, it has gone down as one of the largest capital projects ever completed in Newfoundland. Its stakeholder pool, too, was substantial. And that meant we had to get comfortable wearing a lot of hats—all the time. Over the course of a single day, we easily could find ourselves talking to a PhD who heads an academic department, a drywaller, and a member of the executive board. Seamlessly transitioning from one party to the next, with their individualized project lenses and professional vocabularies, can be something of an art.

Other times, we found ourselves in the position of navigating disparate project partner perspectives. Some were based in Toronto and used to working in the hustle and bustle of a big city. Others were local and had their own approach to doing things. We were the glue that negotiated the differences and kept things moving.

Step by step, our ability to act as an ambassador and think outside the box on this project would enable us to develop the strategies and solutions necessary to carry it across the finish line. Today, the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/csf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core Science Facility</a> is every bit a state-of-the-art laboratory building and a beacon for student collaboration, learning, and discovery on MUN’s St. John’s campus.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryannboyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kerry Ann</a>, Associate at MGAC | RLF.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Kerry Ann!</strong>

<strong>Kerry Ann Ralston (KR):</strong> Hello! Thank you for having me.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Let’s start off with what you do at MGAC | RLF.</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I’m an Associate in the Glasgow office, working in cost management. We help our clients achieve their goals, while managing the costs and minimizing the risks. Our work is very hands-on, as we’re involved in all stages of a project. Here in the Glasgow branch, our projects are mostly in Scotland, but span diverse sectors—commercial, educational, leisure, you name it!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It’s nice to have something a little different on every project! How long have you been with the company, and what were you doing before joining?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I have been here since 2008, so 13½ years now! I’m originally from a small village on the west coast of Ireland and had been working in Dublin for a smaller Quantity Surveying company for four years prior to coming on board. That was after completing university. In those early years, I had completed my chartership and some other professional goals of mine. So, I was at a stage where I was looking for a new experience!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It certainly sounds like you’ve found a great fit then! Was this always something you saw yourself doing when you were younger?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I have to admit, I didn't even know what my job was in high school. I wanted to be an architect or accountant. Though, looking back, I’d say I met those two somewhere in the middle!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It’s true! This line of work is the perfect fit.</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> The difficulty is, when you’re younger and start choosing your career, you don’t even know what’s out there. You might only know of the careers you hear about on TV or, today, on social media. And that can be daunting when you’re 16 or 17 and not knowing what options exist. I try to do my part to educate young people about our industry. I’m a member of the Association of Women in Property. Right now, we are working on our school outreach program that informs young women, and young men as well, about opportunities in our industry. I think for young women especially, seeing a female in the industry is so important.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It absolutely is. Can you share a bit about what’s keeping you busy at work right now?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> One of my key projects is a leisure center called the Helensburgh Waterfront Development. It’s over a year on-site now. Its location is quite interesting. It’s right on the water, so we had to make sure flooding wasn’t a risk. It’s a public facility with a swimming pool, state-of-the-art gym, café, and other recreational areas. It’s a fantastic building, and the location is really something you have to see to believe. You can do your “couch to 5K” while looking out on the water just below you!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What a great asset for the community!</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> It will be! I’m also working on a few National Health Services projects in various stages, from feasibility to construction on-site and a suite of maintenance and refurbishing projects for the University of Dundee as well. And lastly, a project framework for a local authority that’s delivering an early years nursery expansion program, a commitment to provide 1,140 hours funded early learning and nursery hours for young children aged three to five.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow. That really is a great mix of projects across sectors. It must be fun to watch each of them evolve from start to finish.</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I love that about a project; we’re there from the very first day when the design team and client meet to the very end. Through all the key stages, from procurement to bringing the contractor on board to breaking ground on site to completion and handover. And no two projects or days are ever the same, even if you have a repeat client or repeat design team. The project itself has its own face and comes with unique challenges. It’s ever-changing. That’s part of what draws me to it. It’s always something new.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And when you think about all your role in these unique projects, all you’ve been able to accomplish in your career to-date, what impact do you ultimately hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I would like to be known as a team player, and as someone who gave every project my all. Teamwork is so key to what we do, not only within our own organization, but also with the design team, the contractor, all the project team members you work so closely with. We need to all click and be on the same page in order to give the client the end result they are looking for.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You’re right; it’s such a crucial element of this work. When you think about your time on all these projects, working with diverse teams, what challenges have you been faced with</strong>?

<strong>KR:</strong> My life dictates that I have to be able to manage time between my work and my family—which includes my husband, two young kids, and a puppy! So, the biggest challenge for me is typically time management. I’ve developed a few best practices to assist with that. But it also helps that I’m part of a company that is so supportive of its employees. We aren't just numbers on a chair; we know they care about our progression and overall well-being. I feel empowered to have a family and progress my career simultaneously—I’ve never had to choose. That reassurance has helped me be better at what I do every day on the job.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Yes! That makes such a difference. You mentioned you’ve developed some best practices for keeping your time and schedule on track. What’s that look like for you?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> For me, to-do lists are key. I check mine first thing in the morning and update it before I’m finished with work for the day. It’s one of those simple things that can make all the difference, because it helps me determine what needs to be done immediately, and what can be tackled later in the day. It’s like setting very specific deadlines for myself, which always helps me work more effectively.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> We’re fortunate to work across a range of sectors, each with its own way of impacting our community. In education, you have the satisfaction of seeing the buildings give students the best educational experience possible. In healthcare, it’s having the most state-of-the-art facilities for people when they need them. Our leisure projects give the public a place to go for recreation.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s a cool way to look at it! And through this, over time, you are also able to meet the changing needs of the world around you.</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Exactly. We’re constantly adapting and evolving as we work within the context of the times to focus on the key needs of the community. For example, at this moment there is such a major focus on sustainability. So, our team is discussing, “How can we best deliver a sustainable outcome, while also meeting the client’s needs and funding?” Because, of course, these things usually cost a lot more, and we need to consider that. It’s all about achieving that balance.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Great point. What at MGAC | RLF has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Definitely the visions and values. The fundamental focus is on client satisfaction, the client journey. When you see that installed as a core company focus, it automatically becomes your focus too. That’s driven me to ensure the client’s journey is always as smooth as possible, no matter what. To seamlessly adapt as the project adapts. To overcome the hurdles that inevitably will come up.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I’d again go back to the fact that we are able to be present for a client’s whole journey. It’s nice to sit down for the first meeting and hear the project concept and what they want to achieve, and then to be integral in the process of making that a reality. No matter the project, the journey, for me, is always the most rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> The team. I think it’s such an important aspect of any company or any job. We’re so fortunate to have a great team here. We all get involved and help out. And seeing someone else give a project their all drives and motivates you to do the same.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It really does. So, at the end of a long day, after navigating diverse projects and teams, what is your secret to winding down?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Walking my dog, Bailey. He’s a 9-month old labradoodle—so he’s full of life! That’s my off-switch. No phone, no earphones. Just getting out for a walk to clear my head. Fresh air is important for keeping your mind clear.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I make a tea and check my list, taking five minutes to prepare for the day ahead.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Small rituals like that can make all the difference! What’s a book that has made a significant impact on your life?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse. It’s a charming illustration of friendship and compassion, and not being afraid to ask for help. It helps me keep things in perspective when life gets hectic. I remind myself to take five minutes, and that it’s always okay to ask for help. And, ultimately, that everything is going to be okay,

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> “When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s a great one, and so very true. You’ve talked a bit about how colleagues can influence and help each other at work. What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> It’s so important to me to give back to the younger generations coming into this industry. I'm currently mentoring a system Quantity Surveyor who is completing her university. It’s great to see her progressing and to see her confidence growing. I want to give the younger generation the best start possible, because when I was coming out of university, I was fortunate to have a mentor who helped me. We can all be so busy and get wrapped up in our own work, but when you’ve been given the opportunity, I think it’s important to give it back. It’s really all about giving them the time.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s wonderful. Okay, now we’ve got a few rapid-fire questions for you to answer. Are you ready?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Sure!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Helping clients achieve their goals.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s the last thing you do to wrap your workday?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Switch off the computer, clear my desk, and update my to-do list.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> The perfect way to set up the next day! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Probably something like a toy dinosaur or LEGO figurine!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s your go-to lunch?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> A homemade soup or salad.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Probably WhatsApp or Instagram. I quite like Instagram for researching new recipes and design ideas, in particular.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How handy! What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Funny, I've worked with the same people for thirteen years—I think we might just know everything about each other! But maybe just how much I love the outdoors. It could be climbing or going back to my home place in Ireland and getting on a wetsuit to go surfing or paddle boarding.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool. What's your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I think my biggest goal for this year alone is simply getting back in the office and back on track. And in a more ongoing sense, to continue to progress and develop my career.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> On that note, where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I think in five years, I hope I’m carrying out my work, while also progressing up the management line. It will also be interesting to see what changes we see in five years, in terms of industry drivers and how we achieve sustainability net-zero—and other goals that might not even be on our radar yet!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Getting there is a matter of a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between day one and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. We are revisiting them as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. Today, we go <strong>Behind the Build</strong> and revisit our work with NFL Los Angeles. </em>

Leading up to the start of the 2021 regular season, the NFL officially opened the doors of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/nfl-media-headquarters/223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NFL Los Angeles</strong></a>, the league’s brand-new West Coast Headquarters located in the Hollywood Park development in Inglewood, California.

The new league footprint is a big one, with the Class A complex supporting both the business and production arms of the NFL. At 214,063 SF, the building’s office space can accommodate hundreds of daily employees, while 74,922 SF of studio and studio support space quite literally set the stage for state-of-the-art storytelling. The West Coast Headquarters houses flagship operations, such as NFL Network, NFL.com, NFL RedZone, the NFL app, and more. Situated adjacent to SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, the move from Culver City puts the league closer to the action than ever before. It’s the start of a very exciting chapter for the NFL, and we are proud to revisit the role we played in making it all happen.

<h4><strong>BRINGING OUR A-GAME </strong></h4>
Between the project’s high-profile nature, the complexity of a part-office-space part-studio-space headquarters, and the sheer scale of it all, the job required serious expertise. Our team was engaged in 2019 to provide project and cost management services, while the project was in the design phase.

We were fortunate to join an all-star team. As the architects on board for both the base build and tenant improvement work, our friends at <a href="https://www.gensler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gensler</a> created a design for the headquarters that is every bit as exhilarating as the NFL—and every bit as iconic. <a href="https://www.howardbuilding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Building Corporation (HBC)</a> served as the tenant improvement contractor for the build, laying the groundwork for success. <a href="https://www.jackmorton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Morton</a> and <a href="https://ldg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lighting Design Group (LDG)</a> conceptualized the amazing stage and lighting design, while <a href="https://www.showfab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Showman Fabricators</a> provided all the custom fabrication to bring it to life. In addition, <a href="https://onediversified.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diversified</a> provided audio-visual design for the studios, which was a critical component of the project. <a href="https://www.amapc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMA Group</a> provided mission-critical HVAC and power design, <a href="https://www.kgmlighting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KGM</a> served as the leading-edge lighting designer, and <a href="https://tmtechpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TMT Technology</a> was the technology designer for the project. The furniture vendor, <a href="https://www.sheridangroupinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheridan Group</a>, worked closely with Gensler to furnish the space and bring the vision to life. These partners, and everyone on the star-studded <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-Los-Angeles-Fact-Sheet.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project roster</a>, went above and beyond to bring the work across the finish line. As far as project teams go, this was the A-team.

<h4><strong>RUNNING INTERFERENCE AND RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK </strong></h4>
Given the complexity of work and number of project partners, our jobs as project managers and cost consultants were demanding from the jump. Communication was more critical than ever on this project. On any given day, our team might be talking to everyone from NFL executives to lighting and sound specialists to drywallers. There were contractors and subcontractors, and sub-subcontractors. Needless to say, we asked a lot of questions and held many team huddles to keep everyone on track and all of the plates spinning.

It didn’t take long for something to threaten that careful balancing act. As it did with the world at large, COVID-19 entered our lives in a big way during the project's design phase. At a time when much was uncertain, the NFL was very certain about ensuring its new home would be a safe one for its employees. In a very real way, we were designing the plane while it was in the air, and the league invested a significant amount into redesign efforts. Everything was reexamined to ensure safety was at the forefront, which prompted adjustments to many aspects of the project, from the air filtration system down to individual workspaces and bathroom features. Navigating these revisions required an all-hands-on-deck effort. There were design edits and engineering revisions, cost considerations, and schedule implications. That last piece was a major factor as we were all working against an immovable target: the opening of the 2021 NFL regular season—one that would conclude with the highly anticipated Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium.

<h4><strong>SETTING THE STAGE(S) </strong></h4>
Arguably the most unique—and complex—features of the project were all of the scenic elements. The headquarters is home to five film studios, one podcast studio, and one voice-over studio. The plans for Studios 1 and 2 were especially ambitious. Slated for just under 6,000 SF, the concepts for Studio 1 were massive as the stage was designed to produce over 20 different looks based on angles and sets. Studio 2 was to be even larger, sitting at over 6,200 SF. Everything in these studios was designed to be <a href="https://www.sportsvideo.org/2021/09/21/nfl-los-angeles-spotlight-part-2-inside-nfl-medias-new-facility-and-the-cutting-edge-technology-behind-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-of-the-art</a> with next-generation technology used throughout. If executed correctly, the plan would place the studios among the very best in the industry.

A huge part of making that happen hinged on the super grid. As its name implies, the super grid had a literally large presence—and huge implications. Its primary role is to suspend the many lights required for the eventual “lights, camera, action.” Due to the weight of film-quality lights and the sheer number required, the super grid itself needed to be enormously sturdy (and did we mention large?). We’re talking 12,000 SF with a weight of 120,000 pounds: the poundage of nine full-grown African elephants.

Suspending this grid required coordination with lighting design teams, sound engineers, architects, structural engineers, electricians, and HVAC installers. Its structural integrity needed to be absolute to ensure the safety of those working below. It also needed to support critical scenic needs. Beyond light suspension, the grid played a role in sound control. The studios’ prime location next to SoFi Stadium meant a few things. For one, the sweeping windows in one of the studio’s designs allowed for a can’t-be-beat stadium backdrop to shots. It also meant that sound control was a must. To help direct and control the unavoidable noise from the stadium, the grid was also utilized to house isolators throughout studios one and two.

Along the line, there were change orders, schedule shifts, and significant cost considerations. Our team managed every aspect of the highly complex process through many meetings, phone calls, and careful deliberations. In the end, the grid went up without a hitch, and we were able to celebrate a major milestone alongside the many partners involved in the process.

<h4><strong>LEAVING IT ALL ON THE FIELD AND GOING LIVE IN 3…2…1</strong></h4>
It wasn’t just the studios that got the star treatment in the headquarters design. The NFL wanted to make its West Coast Headquarters feel like home for the hundreds of employees under its umbrella. Every flexible workspace was thoughtfully planned to reflect the energy and creativity of the NFL Los Angeles team. The entrance was designed to be as inviting as possible to employees and guests with large-scale water and plant features. Roof access for everyone allows for unrivaled views of SoFi, outdoor gathering spaces are ripe for sunny Los Angeles lunches, and an outdoor practice field can be used as a guest player warm-up area, outdoor film location, or special event space.

No detail was overlooked on this ambitious project, and the complexity of the build and the firm timeline kept us all on our toes, always. That made it all the more rewarding when we were able to deliver for a client that cares so much about the future of sports, of media at large, and, above all, about its employees. This one definitely warranted a touchdown celebration.

Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-riehl-4b93a320/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Riehl</a>, Senior Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>Hello, Kevin! Welcome to the Impact Blog.</strong>

<strong>Kevin Riehl (KR): </strong>Hey! Thanks for having me.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>What is your title, and how long have you been with MGAC?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I’m a Senior Project Manager in our <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology Solutions</a> group. I’ve been with MGAC’s New York office for just over three years.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And what were you doing before you landed here?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Prior to MGAC, I was working in New York on the technology side of a few headquarter expansion projects for a financial software / media company. It was my first substantial job out of college, and where I gained a lot of exposure to network engineering, project management, and the overall construction process. I was on site every day, walking the floors and watching it happen. That was a cool environment to be in right out of the gate, seeing the intersection between technology and construction. When you embed technology in the built environment, it becomes the pulse of a building, a living, breathing thing.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like you really hit the ground running. Was this always the industry you wanted to go into? What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> I’ll be honest: I had no idea! My big plans were to play professional sports or play drums in Metallica—that is, if the drummer quit. Needless to say, I went to college to figure it all out. Ultimately, I majored in Information Technology. It’s something I’ve always had an interest in, being a millennial who grew up with technology and saw its rapid evolution.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>Nice! What’s your alma mater?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Rutgers University.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>So, despite the Metallica dreams not panning out, do you think your younger self would be excited about where you ended up? </strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> Yeah, I think so! Because there’s so much exciting evolution in what I do. It changes day to day, month to month. You have to keep up with what’s going on in the technology world. Not to mention, you’re also dealing with a lot of different people on a daily basis. So, you have to be on your toes, stay engaged, and bring your A-game every day.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So true! Speaking of staying on your toes, what’s been keeping you busy on the job?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Right now, I’m on a large multi-building Headquarters program for a global manufacturing company. MGAC is providing <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program management</a> and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/?service_ids%5B%5D=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project management</a> services and I have the opportunity to work with several of my MGAC colleagues from our various service lines for the client. All told, it’ll be about a five-year project. Prior to this, I’d been working on a major network and technology overhaul for a prestigious University client. Its existing infrastructure could no longer meet the growing needs of the University. We helped them create a technology program to enhance critical aspects of both day-to-day operations and research. It was a cool job to be involved with because it is absolutely helping people do their jobs better and more efficiently every day.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like in just a few years, you’ve had the opportunity to work on some pretty meaningful projects. When you think about your time with MGAC on the whole, what impact do you hope to have here?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I hope to be known as someone who always went above and beyond and who was able to anticipate problems. If I couldn’t anticipate a problem, be it for a client or for MGAC internally, I was able to react and collectively problem-solve with the team.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Anticipation is really the name of the game in project management, isn’t it? </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Absolutely. One of the first things I learned about project management is the importance of always staying a few steps ahead. If you occasionally anticipate something that doesn’t come to fruition, no harm, no foul. But, as soon as things inevitably do change, you’ve got to be ready to pivot and figure it out.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Of course, the pandemic is still fresh in everyone’s mind. In spring of 2020, I had been working on-site on the University client’s project for about a year and a half. Suddenly, we went fully remote. The client’s goals and objectives changed; it was that weird time where no one knew what was going to happen. There was an unrelated facilities project that involved moving a data center across campus that needed our support, so we pivoted to that. At first, doing it remotely felt like a daunting task. Luckily, the relationship with the client and team was in place, and we were able to gather the team, communicate, and get a plan in place. Ultimately, we were able to execute it on time and within budget. It was a big success—and a great crash course in communicating in the age of COVID-19.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span></strong><strong> </strong><strong>You could say that! How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong> As I mentioned before with our university work, we deploy technology that helps people do their jobs more efficiently. But the funny thing about technology is, when it’s working well, you don’t think about it. We put technology into buildings that, more often than not, no one notices. And that’s the goal. Because when the platform is reliable and secure, when there are no downtimes or hardware failures, it means you can go about your job. It means research can continue. And that can have profound impacts on a community.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>The team spirit and the way people approach each other. In this line of work, we’re constantly tasked with finding answers to problems we haven’t encountered before. At MGAC, we recognize that there’s never just one way to do something. So, we put our heads together to find solutions, and everyone's perspective is always considered. Great ideas come out of that.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Just assessing—and appreciating—everything we are able to do for our clients over a project’s term. It’s easy to get tied up in the day-to-day stuff when you’re going 100 MPH. You can forget the progress you’ve made on a project, especially after three to five years! It’s rewarding to step back and look back at it from a higher level and take inventory of what’s been accomplished.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What gives you energy?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>My desire to continue learning. Whether from my teammates or if I’m going for a certification in the industry. Staying hungry gives me energy.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>KR:</strong> It might sound counterintuitive to “winding down,” but over the past year, I’ve built a home gym in my garage. I blast music, get a workout in, and then I’m done for the day. It’s a nice way to create separation from work and home when you’re working from home.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I get up, let the dog out, drink some coffee, and read the news. I’m a simple guy when it comes to that.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Hey, if it ain’t broken! Tell us about your pup.</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>His name is Charlie. He’s a chihuahua-terrier mix that we adopted during the pandemic. He’s the most anxious dog on the planet, but he’s also very cute.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Name a book that’s changed the way you see the world.</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Actually, I’m reading one right now. It’s called <em>Hard Work Pays Off</em>. The author, Matt Fraser, is a five-time CrossFit champion who broke his back early in his career. He had to overcome that. The book is all about the mindset of overcoming adversity. It’s a good story that translates well to life in general.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>“Don’t let yesterday take up too much of today.” I heard the quote years ago and had to look up who said it. Turns out, it was Will Rogers. It resonates with me because being present is key to everything—especially nowadays, with so many distractions all around.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You could definitely say that quote has stood the test of time. What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I’d like to be known as someone who prioritizes listening over speaking. It’s something I sometimes struggle with, because I can get so excited about ideas and want to jump right in. But listening is so vital. It plays into building trust and forging long-lasting relationships—both of which are paramount in the work we do.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Well said. We now have a few rapid-fire questions for you. Ready?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Sure!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Bringing clarity to ambiguity.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Nice one. What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I open my email and see if I missed anything overnight. Just informational stuff.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And the last thing?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I close my laptop and put a pin in the day. And I try to remember to throw out the various Post-it notes I’ve scribbled on throughout the day and stuck to the sides of my monitor.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>There’s a fiber patch cable in my work bag. It’s used to connect a backend system. I don’t know why I have it. I’ve been carrying it around for so long, and it’s followed me with every new work bag I get. But I know one day someone is going to need it, and I’ll be that guy who has it.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Spotify and Instagram. My wife is constantly posting pictures of our dog and now, our new baby!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Congrats! What's your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I'm going to go for an industry certification, the RCDD. It essentially involves reading a really long book and then taking a test.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>Wrapping up the project I’m currently working on, for starters! But in general, I hope I’m continuing to move up the management team here at MGAC and assisting in building out our Technology Solutions group.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> </strong><strong>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>KR: </strong>I played drums in a cover band throughout college. We played everything from Led Zeppelin to Britney Spears on the Jersey Shore scene.

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Bryan: Hi, and welcome to MGAC Inner Voices podcast, digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Just as always, I want to preface this podcast by letting you know that we're not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. We just want to share our stories, our shared experiences, and discuss how together we can recreate a better outcome for all of us in the industry and beyond. I'm Bryan Gamez. My pronouns are he/him. I'm a project manager at MGAC, working and living in L.A.

And today we have the privilege and honor to speak with Yolanda Baber. She is a transformational leader in business process management, client and business development, project management, and client engagement. She has been providing project management services and business development leadership for more than 24 years, which is amazing. Her expertise is in governmental compliance, plan, check, review, permitting, geotechnical engineering, subsurface imaging, underground utilities investigations, potholing, mapping, CCTV, QAQC, construction inspection and material testing scope of services and projects.

She currently serves on the Business Development Association of the Inland Empire and is the vice president. She also serves on the Construction Management Association of America Creating Opportunities for Diversity and Equality committee, the Society of Marketing Professional Services where she's the sponsorship director and on the program's committee, vice president board of director for the National Association of Women in Construction Chapter, and the Association of Society of Civil Engineers of San Bernardino, the president-elect.

You have an incredible resume. Can you introduce yourself to our listeners?

Yolanda: Absolutely. So my name is Yolanda Baber. I go by she/her but really I definitely considered myself to be a blackxican and/or a black or Afro-Latina. That was what my nickname would be. I'm based out of the Los Angeles region. I live in the Moravia mountains. The one thing that you need to know is that I have an amazing son. I am a one only son bearer. He's 28 years old out of Houston, Texas. His name is Seth. And I've been married to an amazing husband for the last five years. His name is Steven Baber.

Bryan: I'm really happy to have you here. Afro Latina. Where are you from? Because I'm Latino as well. I'm Guatamalan.

Yolanda: My family is kind of a mixture. I think the diversity definitely has been embedded in me through my DNA. So my mother is half Italian and half Spanish and a Navajo Indian, and my dad is African-American. So I had the privilege of being raised by my stepfather who was from Jalpa, Zacatecas and so my first language is Spanish. By nature, I actually learned how to speak English in public school and so I was in ESL classes. Oh, for those who don't know what that is, it's English Second Language all the way to the sixth grade in public school so I know how to read and write in Spanish,

Bryan: You know, with someone who's as diverse as you, have you faced any challenges in your career because of your identity?

Yolanda: You'll know this about me, I'm kind of a half glass full type of person. The challenges that I've faced really have a lot to do with areas of opportunity. And so I, kind of, looked at the areas of where I was the only woman sitting at the table, the only woman who was my color of skin and that I was a single mother, right? So there's a lot of different diversities that are in there. But what I started to do is to take advantage of the diversity. And so the whole concept of "do you have a seat at the table" was something that I never fought for that spot. I created my own platform. Nobody had to invite me to the table. I just set up my own meetings and invited others to be at the table.

And so the conversations were very fluid. It was really more about knowing the knowledge. My background is in marketing and sales and business development. I've always worked in the technical industry, which means that I'm dealing with architects, engineers, mechanical engineers, you know, electrical engineers. And so they have a different flow of how they communicate.

So my challenge really was never the industry. It was more about how do I mirror and match my conversation to make them feel comfortable so that they can tell me what they need from me and how I can support them. That was my biggest, I think, challenge is understanding the vernacular and really understanding the flow of what their discipline in the industry really represented.

Bryan: You know, I really like that aspect that you're talking about. You're creating a seat for yourself. I think when we look at diversity and all the conversations I've had, there's a struggle. How can I approach a situation? But the conversation should be geared to, how can you break the rules now? You know, we want to be a rule-breaker, and it seems like you are that rule-breaker, Yolanda, and that's how you create that opportunity for yourself. I think that's the way we should gear a lot of the conversations moving forward.

You talk about creating these opportunities for yourself. Did you ever find that, when you were younger in your career, that it was more of a challenge? Were you always a go-getter? And would you ever actually give your younger self any advice to help with that starting off?

Yolanda: I would definitely tell my younger self is that don't ask for permission. And so you don't need to ask for permission. You just need to move forward. I do think it's important to also give really, I'm gonna say, credit, and I'm gonna say support and really say that who invited me to the table and brought me to the table was another man. Richard Corey, who was my initial mentor of the entire industry, from Corey Engineering, he invited me to the table. He said, "Hey, Yolanda, I need you to take advantage. I need you to take the lead on these initiatives for our organization. I need you to break through some of these ceilings that I've been experiencing. I need you to do to step into space and tell me what we can do to roll and expand our market sector." Our whole market share was really the area of opportunity. Basically, it told me, "Here's where I want you to grow. Here's where I want you to move forward." He basically gave me permission to shine. He said, "Hey, I can't attend this meeting. I need you to go represent me. Hey, I'm coming with you, but I need you to lead the whole meeting." I do want to say and I want to preface this that I think it's really important now that I get to sit at the table. I get to invite other women and other men to join me in these efforts. But the reality was is that I had to be invited in order for me to sit at that table initially.

Now, if you were to ask me today, I would probably not ask for permission. I will just create what is what I normally do now. I create opportunities. I set up meetings. I'm the one saying, "Hey, I'm going to spearhead this initiative here. I'm going to spearhead here," and then I invite people who I think would champion those efforts and support me in making those things done. I think honoring the privilege of working with a man who was literally... Richard Corey was only about seven or eight years older than me, but he had so much wisdom about the industry, and I think this is really important because who you play with and who you put in your inner circle has a lot to do with what your end results will become. He said, "There is no limit." He spoke unlimited conversations to me every day. He said, "There is no cap on your income."

Bryan: I love that Yolanda.

Yolanda: As a single mother, raising a young man who liked to eat a lot of food and was growing like... I don't know. I don't know. It seemed like he grew out of his clothes every three months. And so when he began to speak limitless opportunities for me, it gave me permission to step into that space. And every time I get an opportunity to tell the story, I want to tell the story because there was no women at the table 25 years ago. When I joined, I was always the only one, and it was almost like I was invited as a special guest to the meeting because they wanted to get my insight.

Bryan: It's great for someone like me and also to some of our listeners to hear that you have created and forged your own path, especially with Richard. It sounds like he was a great mentor that a lot of people are seeking these days. And sometimes I think people have a tough time navigating that path by themselves, and they usually think that they're navigating the path by themselves, but there are people out there that are willing to help you out. Was there ever a time when you were starting that you were scared, that you were scared to speak up, even though you were given, it sounds like, these great opportunities? I guess my question really is geared to our listener who may be an Afro Latina, you know, single mom. How can she create that opportunity for her if she's feeling scared to sit at that table?

Yolanda: I think the one thing that's really important is that, if you've been invited to the table, you need to own it. If you were invited to that meeting, you were asked to be present, that means that you were there to contribute and to add value, trust your value, trust that you are worthy and that you are enough.

Bryan: And don't doubt yourself. That is something I tell my girlfriends all the time, Yolanda. I say, if you think something's off, then you're probably right. You're probably correct that something is off. It's not because someone is questioning you. It's because you need to trust yourself. And they're like, "You're right, Bryan." I'm like, yeah, because I see this too often with a lot of my girlfriends who are at different industries, and a lot of my best friends are girls. I develop great connections with women. I think in my career I've been mentored by women and I just trust them. There is almost a sixth sense that women have about intuition, and don't doubt yourself because that creates fear, and that's when you won't be able to flourish in the workplace or even personally. So I think that's really great advice, Yolanda. Do you have any advice for people that have ever experienced microaggressions in the workplace or have you ever experienced any microaggressions and how did you deal with that?

Yolanda: Can you define? Because I don't want to assume that I actually understand what microaggression means.

Bryan: Sure. Have you ever felt like you were discriminated against because of your gender identity, your skin color? Did you ever face it head-on and how did you deal with that situation?

Yolanda: Thank you so much for clarifying that for me. I think, in the very beginning of my career, I did not pay much attention to microaggression, okay?

Bryan: Interesting.

Yolanda: I did not, and I'll tell you why.

Bryan: Wow.

Yolanda: And I'll tell you why. I honestly didn't know that anybody had a problem with me.

Bryan: I love that. You know, I have to say to our listeners, Yolanda is radiating this confidence and she is confident, but I love that because I think that we need that self-confidence because sometimes I even get into my own head but continue. Sorry.

Yolanda: There's a level of naïveness in me that I have to tell you that everything in life to me, I always practice this, is that everything that is happening, everything I'm experiencing is a positive intent. Nobody's going to come... Even though the world is cynical, I approach my life that way, that everything I'm experiencing is a positive intent. So, whenever my brain goes to something negative, I immediately auto-correct my thought process to look at what is it that I'm supposed to be getting out of that conversation. In my professional career, because I wasn't paying attention for the clues, it didn't even bother me that I was around all men that were plus 50 years old who've never actually been around people my age and have never really been around people like me. They never worked with people like me. And they will never say that to me.
But what made me or confirmed to me that I was different than them is the way they ask questions about me. So they were very cautious, right, until they figured out that I was just like anybody else and that I wanted to express who I was and I wasn't scared to share who I was. And so I think giving them permission also to ask and also to engage with me. I'll give you an example. I was sitting at a table one time and I probably was in my early 30s. And I was sitting at the table with a large transportation agency, and the gentleman that was sitting across from me was probably in his mid-60s. He was part of the Civil Rights. Like, he participated in it. He knew about it. He understand the Civil Rights. He knew more about the Civil Rights than I did. Not only from the standpoint of experiencing them because he grew up with my mom's generation, right? And so I began to ask him, how did he feel about the Civil Rights Movement? How did that impact him as a person? In fact, how did that shift and change who he was as a person or having to engage with the population at hand, right? And so he said...he began to be super transparent. He was also a foreigner. He looked Caucasian, but he was a foreigner, right?

And so as we begin to talk, he says, "I felt a lot of what you felt." And I was like, "What?" He's like, "Yes." And I go, "Tell me. Talk to me about that." This guy ended up becoming one of my closest friends, right? And to this day, we're still friends. He's been retired now going on 10 years. And I think one of the things that I thought was so interesting was that what I do to be the difference-maker in he and I and the fact that he didn't have the same skin color as me did not matter. I was having an actual conversation with him, and that made him feel comfortable. He felt unassuming. He was open. And by the way, I did ask for permission for me to ask those questions, just so you know. So I gave him permission to ask him whatever he felt he wanted to ask me and then I asked him if it was okay if I asked him more about. And I said, "And if you feel uncomfortable about anything we're talking about, then just..."

So this kind of went on for years. We would meet once a month, and we would talk about our family. He ended up coming over to my barbecues at my house. I ended up going to his family events that he was hosting. I got to know his wife. I got to know his children. And so I feel like sometimes whatever you deem to be a difference-maker actually is what actually brings us together. What I found is that the differences were never as more important than just communicating. And what I found is that the culture match was what brought us together. The fact that he and I got along was because we saw something in each other that we liked. There was something that we felt comfortable to have the conversations.

So I think if you remove the color, if you remove the biases, if you remove religion, and where you grew up, and, "I'm from San Gabriel Valley. I was born and raised in West Covina, California," which is my story, right, if I take that all out of the equation and just have an honest, open conversation, there's so much more that brings us together. There's so much commonality as human beings. So the microaggression that I experienced, I actually use it as a leverage, and I would just have an honest conversation, and I would say, "Hey, what would you advise me? How do you feel that I can do my assignment better to grow my market share? What do you think I should do?" And the more I begin to ask the questions, they felt like they were coaching and training me. And so because of that, they became really good mentors to me and great friends. So I think looking at a microaggression situation as an opportunity to have a conversation about it.

Bryan: Yes. And you know what's interesting? I was just listening to NPR yesterday. Do you know Eartha Kitt, that woman?

Yolanda: Yes, yes.

Bryan: So, her daughter has written a memoir, and she talked about this anecdote. They were in South Africa, and Eartha Kitt is a more light-skinned black woman and very famous. And we have her daughter who looks almost white, very blonde hair, very light-skinned. And there were at an amusement park in South Africa. The amusement park didn't know who Eartha Kitt was, and they discriminated against her. They said, "You need to leave." She said, "Okay, well, I'm going to leave," and took her daughter.

And then she does a photoshoot and the headlines were like, "Eartha Kitt removed from the amusement park," whatever. And Eartha Kitt then said, "I could have made a huge scene at the amusement park. I could have said, 'This is completely wrong,' " but she knew that she was going to leverage that situation and create a bigger opportunity for the community by saying in the headlines, "You know, what can this amusement park do?" The owner said, "I apologize. What can I do?" and she said, "My daughter really wants to come back. Can I bring our friends?" She went back to the amusement park and she brought back children of all races, and it was that opportunity that gave much more leverage in that situation and also did so much more good to the community and also to the movement.

I think what you're saying hits the nail on the head, that we should leverage all those opportunities, understand what is the positive impact I can make later. I want to know more if you ever felt unsafe in any work environment. Or, have you ever seen anyone be treated in an unsafe manner, and have you ever said anything?

Yolanda: So you have to know this about me is that I'm a natural advocate. I'm the oldest of the kids. So I have a brother whose name is Jose, and I have a sister named Nikita. I am the only one in my family that's African-American. My brother and my sister are both Hispanic. Jose had blonde hair and green eyes. He kind of looked like a Gerber baby. He was a towhead baby, and he just was super sweet, just a really soft spirit type of young man. And as we were growing up, we moved from San Gabriel Valley to San Diego. We were living in Logan Heights. It's not the safest neighborhood, but at that time, my brother was the minority. He looked like the minority of the group, right? So at a very young age, I was always a protector of my people. I always stood up for my family. I stood up for the people that I represented. So from a very young age, I was usually the one protecting my brother and/or my sister. Even my sister now who's a lot more mature, I'm still protecting my sister. I think it's just a natural thing that I was...I was gifted with that gift to do that.

I work around a lot of young ladies who are either an internee or maybe they might be five years in their career. And so they'll come and say things to me like, "Hey, this is what's happening. This is what I'm experiencing." And so immediately my antenna goes up. I'm like, "Hold up. When did that happen?" And so I begin to ask questions. And I'm asking for the purpose of getting intel so that I can go back and advocate. So I think the thought process is that, as an individual person, I can't think of any one time that I felt fearful of anybody coming at me any kind of way, because I was always the type of person that I demand respect. And when I step in the room, people know I'm present. So I've never felt like a threat by anybody or anything of that nature, but I have become an advocate for others.
And so if you're the person who's being abused, then recruit somebody who can support you with that process. Sometimes you may not have the voice or you may feel that you may not communicate it correctly. On your team, everybody has an advocate. That's the person you want to confide in. You want to go and talk to them about what's happening and find out how you can mitigate or create a safer environment for you individually. It is okay to ask for help if needed.

Bryan: I think everyone should feel safe enough in their work environments today to be able to reach out to that inner circle and say, "Hey, I want to speak to you, and I want to be able to create a better, safer work environment for everyone, not just myself. Because if it's happening to you or anyone else, it could be happening to a lot more other folks." So that's always an important step to take. And this, kind of, just brings us to the big question, why we're having this conversation. Why is diversity, equity, and inclusion so important in the workplace? Everyone's talking about it now. We have committees forming, and also with 2020, the movement. There's Black Lives Matter. Why do you think is it now today that we are finally taking a larger step in trying to create a more equitable environment? Why is it so important?

Yolanda: I think that we've always been practicing diversity, equity, and inclusion. What I've seen in the last few years is that we're actually living it. So there's a difference, right? So, I think what happened is you and I actually were forced to sit in front of a computer for whatever amount of timeframe during the COVID-19 series. And so all of a sudden, all the distractions were all, kind of, eliminated because now we couldn't do certain things. Now, the attention was what we could see on the screen, what we can see on our phone, what we can see on our iPad. So this whole injustice of what was happening to Black Lives Matter, it basically was now put on the forefront, and now everybody and anybody in the environment was now watching it, even the people who were practicing it and the people who were against it, right? There's always a pros and cons to all that was happening.

But then people started thinking like, "If we allow this to happen to them, then they can do it to us." So there was a "us" movement of different sorts. But what started to happen is, like, if a police officer can smother somebody to death in plain sight, in a plane environment, in the middle of the street, in the middle of the day, that means that that can happen to us. So it, kind of, personalized the pain. It personalized the violations. It personalized what we were seeing. And so now it was like an outrage and an outpour. It's like, "Oh, my God, we have to do something about it." I mean, it got people to go outside and protest in the middle of a COVID season because of the unjustice that they saw, but I think it's because they started to see the humanity and the violation of human rights being displayed in such a vulgar manner that they felt that they had to move into action.

I still feel like diversity, equity, and inclusion is a topical conversation. In some organizations, it's a very, I'm going to say, entrenched conversation. Like, there is a active flow of diversity, equity, and inclusion happening within the organization, but I still feel that there's one component that we have a tremendous opportunity to do something about. It's this whole conversation of belonging. So, here, we have some who are like, "Okay, diversity, we understand by definition what diversity means, right? We know what it looks like to practice inclusion. We understand what the word equity means, right, and making things equitable and being accountable for that." But then this whole conversation right in the center that talks about belonging.

So think about this, Bryan. So I say to you, "Hey, hey, Bryan, let's get together. We're going to go do Taco Tuesday in Downtown and East L.A. We're going to go to the taco [inaudible 00:23:02], whatever your favorite place is."

Bryan: Yes.

Yolanda: Yes, right? And we're going to meet up, right? And so you and I get together, and we do life together. We talk about our friends, our family, you know, who we love, who we care about, all that fun stuff. But now this is what I say to you, "Bryan, I want to do a really special happy hour, and I want you to help me pick the signature drink. I want you to help me pick who should be attending. I need you to help me pick the restaurant that we're going to be going to. And by the way, I need you to invite your personal friends to also come." That is true belonging. I feel like we're on second base still, inching to get to the third base with this whole DEI thing, and I feel like what we're missing on the third base is having the conversation of belonging. How will we take the masses of our organization and the people that we're engaging on a daily basis? But how do we make it personal?

Bryan: And how do you think that we do that? I think that DEI has come a long way in the last two years. And you're absolutely right. There's a difference between practicing it and living it. I still feel that DEI is not being fully committed to by companies. So what do you think is a good strategy for senior leadership or companies to create that sense of belonging for everyone? When it comes to equity, I also think of pay. I think that pay should be equal. It's always on the news, right? It's been on the news for two years or whatever, more than two years. Last two years, it's been flashing on the news more often, but it was on the news last night. And I thought to myself, what can we do? So what do you think?

Yolanda: Those of us who are in the industry and we get to decide what people are going to get paid for the services that they provide, we need to contend and pay them equal pay. If you are a hiring manager for your firm, it could be for your firm, it could be for a law firm, it could be somebody in the AC world, no matter what job, you must pay men and women the same rate. I think the human resource community, the hiring managers need to contend for their people. I think the person who's deciding what rate should be paid should be paying the same equitable amount of what our counterparts are making. If everybody made 100% commitment to do that, that will immediately change.

Second is evaluate your pay structure. If you already have people who've been working for your organization for 25, 30 years, and they're still earning 40% less than their counterpart who just started five years ago, then there has to be an equitable research and analysis done on how do you get that person who's earning less money with way more experience. And there's companies that I'm aware of that are actually doing that right now. They're actually having these conversations about pay and equitability when it comes to pay structures.

So, first, number one, if you're the hiring manager, ensure that that is 100% being practiced. Number two, and if you're in an organization where you have the seat at the table to open the conversation with the CEOs, and CFOs, and human resource directors to say, "Hey, we need to open up our books. Let's talk about what everybody is earning." And if we need to upscale, meaning that if we need to keep people, that's why there's so much movement right now. People are moving from company to company. Most of them are chasing the opportunity of earning what their counterparts are making.

So, let's eliminate that because we need those people to stay connected in the organizations that they're in because there's intellectual capacity that we lose every time somebody leaves, and it's costing us a lot of money. If it's us taking the cost analysis and the pay structure that we currently have in place, and find where there's equitable differences, and can we now take the person who might be making 40% less, can we make a commitment that in the next five years, we would increase their pay 10% to get them to in the next five years? And can I tell you something else? We need to have a conversation with that employee and let them know that that's what our intention is to do. It'll immediately let them know they are important to us.

Bryan: And give that sense of belonging that we've been talking about.

Yolanda: I'll admit I've chased paper, but here's the reality. After I have done all that I've done, today, my number one goal is my legacy is to have a life that really matters, so that when I leave this industry, I can get the "well done." You've done all that you've done, and there's a legacy that is driven based on my efforts and what I have brought to the table. And what might your contribution is—I'm going to say this to the audience—your contribution is important. It is just as important as mine or Bryan. All of us have a level of contribution no matter how big or small you may think. You add value to the whole equation of what is happening. So I just want you to know because of that, what you think, what you say, your behavior matters.

Bryan: One hundred percent. We want everyone to know that they matter. Trust your instincts. Trust your intuition. And I'm really happy that you're diving into these strategies, Yolanda, because I think in past conversations, I think we have struggled to come up with concrete actions. And I think that companies aren't taking that forward. For example, my friend, they don't want to leave the company, but they almost feel like they don't have an option, they don't have a choice because they don't feel like they have that sense of belonging. They have a disappointment and then resentment towards a company. And I think when you have an employee that leaves a company and has resentment, I think that actually does a lot more damage to the reputation because word spreads.

Yolanda: I really believe that all of us who are running the organizations and if we're in an area of leadership, that we're to champion DEI, that we're saying diversity, equity, and inclusion and belonging counts, and it's important. And it's not just talk about, like, we have matrix. Llike, we met the requirement. We must have this amount of women, this amount of multiracial people in the mix. As a collective group, how do we make ourselves accountable for that process?

I'm really, really blessed. After all these years, I finally feel like I've found my right culture and the right space that I'm currently in. From the president to the vice president, to the operations people, to the person that's working as a project manager in the field, everybody has embraced this whole diversity, equity, and inclusion conversation. And it's not just lip service. I have been here. I see it in full action. Like, there's committees that just talk about engagement. There's a group of people who just talk about how do we make the environment in our workspace fun. They actually have real means. Like, they actually talk, like, what can we plan for the next two, three months that's going to make our job fun? There is space for that.

Sometimes we will say, "This might be an anomaly. This might just be happening for you. I want to challenge you. Have you been practicing diversity, equity, and inclusion? Have you been practicing biases and not know that you're practicing them?" I'll give you an example. Most people don't even assume that I speak Spanish and that Spanish was my primary language because they make the assumption because I have braids and I'm expressive, they kind of lump me in one community. And when we start talking about biases, I've been wearing my hair this way probably for 15 years. I love that it's long. It's easy. I can put it in a ponytail.

Bryan: It's beautiful, Yolanda.

Yolanda: I love it. Okay. Well, listen, I have a bias. I will not part my hair in the center of my face because somebody told me my nose was too big. I was probably in the third grade. My teacher said to me...

Bryan: Your teacher said that to you?

Yolanda: I had two ponytails with a big [inaudible 00:30:48] bun at the end, you know, with all the colorful stuff. You know, I'm definitely an '80s '90 baby, right? So I had the big ponytail and she said, "Oh, wow. Your nose is really big." I never even knew my nose was big compared to everybody else but now, because she said it, I started looking around the room. So biases and things that you experience sometimes work our thought process. I mean, even how we style ourselves, how we wear clothing, because somebody told us that the skirt was too short. Now that might've been true, okay, but we still see short. That might've been true, but that doesn't mean you need to modify your whole outfit. That doesn't mean that you have to modify your look in all environment.

I think if we challenge ourselves individually, we'll start to figure out that there's some individual biases. Even if you're a part of a community that's been marginalized, right? You even have some biases not realizing that it's just something that's been innate in you. I think every single one of us, if we all raise our hand, we do have some biases. We do have culturally some differences and things of that nature but just acknowledge it. I think it's okay to just acknowledge it and not let that be the determining factor of how you engage others.

Bryan: It's an exercise in self-awareness. I find that some people struggle in understanding their surroundings and their own biases. So it's a really powerful exercise that people should look into, and it helps determine whether or not you are practicing what you're preaching is the point that we're trying to make here. These are all really inspiring, Yolanda. The more I'm speaking to you, the more I find you so inspiring. I think that all our listeners could learn so much from you. Sometimes it feels like there are people that aren't advocating for you, and it's really nice to speak with someone like you who has seen it and is practicing it. So I just want to take this moment to just thank you because it's really important, the conversations to have. Where do you see the industry in 10 years?

Yolanda: I only see it being better and getting better. So the whole month of March is Women's Celebration Month. We are all celebrating women. If you ask me, that should be a 365-day challenge, celebrating women, right? Last week was focused specifically on women in construction. The boots on the ground to the person who's sitting in an executive seat, every single woman should be valued for their contribution overall. But I think what's so key is that it's not just that they should be acknowledged just for the month of March. I'm not saying that men shouldn't be celebrated. I think men and women should all be celebrated daily for what they bring to the table.

I was thinking about this the other day is like, how do you show people that they bring value to the table, that they're special to you? You need to tell them that they're special to you. For the L.A. Orange County region, I am the vice president for the National Association of Women in Construction. So we host WIC Week, which is every single event is tailored around women in construction being featured. We talk about, you know, their contributions. So it was really a platform to really elevate and really celebrate women in construction, right?

And so, as we were meeting, mind you, it was probably one of the best event that I have been to in the last couple of years. And can I tell you what the real juice came for me was when I was pulled to the side and somebody said to me, "What I heard today changed me. I am going back home and re-evaluating what I'm doing." I really, really appreciate what this person said. I appreciate how I felt when I stepped into the room. I really appreciate the fact that I felt welcomed. If somebody were to say, "Okay, what is the legacy you want to bring?" that to me is the secret sauce is what imprint are you leaving behind or are you pouring into people right now. That is what really matters.

Bryan: The empathy that you're showing, the confidence that you're preaching and you're exuding, and just everything you're saying, you are practicing it. I think that in this industry and I speak for myself, I struggle with meeting individuals that are as powerful as you are. And powerful, I mean in terms of, like, self-empowerment. I feel empowered to do more change in this industry because I know there are good people in this industry like yourself. And I think a lot of our listeners are going to value that. You bring a perspective that is so totally unique, that is going to help others chase resources and understand what those resources may be. And I think maybe what would be helpful is if we can share what those platforms are and what those resources are on our website so that we could help others, because I think in 10 years' time, I do think that our industry will be completely different. I think there are going to be several mentors. There's going to be resources groups in every company that are going to help others achieve their goals because they shouldn't be prevented from achieving anything just because they think that there's a stigma. This is what we're trying to create here. What are your final thoughts on this?

Yolanda: Outside of our careers, let's just kind of remove the titles, remove the job, remove the degrees, remove your social status, you know, what zip code you live in, what kind of car you drive, okay? If you remove all the masks and all the stuff, when it all comes down to it, we're human beings. We're flesh and blood. We're human beings with a real heart and a real sensitive spirit. We're really created in such a special way. If we're living in our most authentic life, how we do things at home is how we're going to do things at work.

In my mind, I always felt like I had to behave a different kind of way in my work environment. My core values didn't change when I went to work. If I had bad core values at home, I'm going to have bad core values at work. So what I found is that I didn't need to live a different lifestyle. It took me a while to get there. I don't think that if we had this conversation 20 years ago, that I would have answered the questions you shared with me the same way, but I do feel that today, I think it's important that however it is that we do one thing is how we're going to do everything. Whatever your strengths and weaknesses, areas of opportunity for growth, your threats, all the SWOT analyses that we talk about in the business, we have to practice that for ourselves.

If there's something that you do naturally, that you can do one, two, three, that's your highest, best use of your time. If it's something that you have to think about and you have to go like, "Oh, my word, it's going to take me a whole week to process," that's probably not the area of expertise that you should be in and stop forcing yourself to become good at that area. You don't have to. I can say that after 25 years, I can say that. I remember when we were having the conversation about board assignments. I don't have no business being a treasurer or a secretary because I'm gonna spend all the money and I'm not gonna take notes. It's okay to say that, you know? So when they ask me, "Well, what assignment do you want to be in?" I was like, "Well, I can't do that, I can't do that, but I can help you with this. Well, I could do that." Whatever genuinely makes you smile that you enjoy doing, then that's what you should be doing every day.

I think that if you take the position on an everyday basis, that people are watching you, people are learning your good and your bad behaviors.

Bryan: Yes. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Yolanda: Now, do you want your legacy to be greatness and duplicatable and moving forward, or do you want it to be something else? If you're an intern that is listening to this podcast, you're an intern, you just started working for somebody in the industry or you're the person who's been in the business 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, I think it's so important for you to know thy self. You need to know who you are and what you do best and go do that. I just want to empower you and challenge you to be your very best at what you do well, and all the doors will be open because it's something you naturally know how to do. So opportunities are going to be knocking down on your door as soon as you get comfortable in that thing that you know that you have the best ability to excel in.

Bryan: And when you live your most authentic life, you're going to live your most passionate life. You're going to follow your passions. And as Yolanda said, the opportunities are going to keep flowing. I'm going to misquote it, but one thing that Oprah has said is we all want to be heard. We all want to know that we matter. And it all just begins with communication and listening to each other. These tips that you have given, Yolanda, are so important. I mean, you are the epitome of empowerment, I would say. And I'm really happy to have had you on our podcast.

And with that, Yolanda, I couldn't have had more of an amazing conversation with you. You are absolutely amazing. You're so stunning. I love your braids, and you have a beautiful nose, so I don't know whatever teacher said that. So, thank you again for joining us.

Yolanda: Thank you for having me.

Bryan: And, everyone, thank you for listening to this episode of MGAC Inner Voices. We hope to be able to provide some useful links or resources for you in case you have any questions. And with that, just check back next month for our episode.]]></wp:meta_value>

Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-hudson-83445935/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Hudson</a>, Senior Bid Manager at MGAC | RLF.

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Amy!</strong>

<strong>Amy Hudson (AH):</strong> Hi! It’s great to be here.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Tell us what you do here at MGAC | RLF.</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I am the UK’s Senior Bid Manager. I’m based out of the Birmingham office, and I predominately lead and work on pursuits for the Midlands region. But I also manage national framework pursuits.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And when did you first join the company?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I first joined RLF in 2015 as a Bid Coordinator, working largely on cost management bids. I left in 2018 to get a little more experience working with different service disciplines and in different sectors for a larger international company. I learned loads there, but it turns out I couldn’t keep away from RLF! In June 2021, I re-joined as Bid Manager.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Awesome! Let’s back up a little more—what first brought you to RLF back in 2015? Were you already working in the industry?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I’ve actually always been in the industry. I’ve worked in construction since I was 16, and I’m now nearly 34. So, literally all I’ve known is construction! I started as an apprentice working for main contractors. That developed into estimating, and I got a flair for submission packages and working on bids. I ultimately spent 10-plus years working with contractors, and in 2015 I moved over to the consultancy side.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool. So was this always a path you planned to go down when you were younger?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> To be honest, when I was younger I didn't know what I wanted to do. That’s why I didn't go straight from school to additional studies. I wanted to get into an apprenticeship, start working, and learn that way instead. It was fortunate that I fell in love with the industry I chose!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So true! And it definitely sounds like your plan to learn on the ground paid off.  </strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> It really did. I came in as an apprentice at 16, doing business administration, and I also explored HR, marketing, and then estimating. I found that I really enjoyed going out and working on site. Today, my experience working with technical teams and understanding of how buildings are built makes all the difference in how I approach my Senior Bid Manager role.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Speaking of the work you’re doing today, what’s been keeping you busy?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> In the last few months, specifically for the Midlands region, we’ve had some high-profile tenders come in. We recently got the all-clear on appointments for a massive new mixed-use development in Birmingham. It’s in a part of the city center that’s being regenerated, with lots of investment going in. The project will be phased out into plots: it’s part residential, part retail, and part commercial. It was a massive bid to put together, so it was incredible to see all of our hard work pay off when we landed it. We’ve also got a lot of higher education tenders at the moment, and are waiting for a massive national framework to land. So safe to say, it’s really busy!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You aren't kidding! As you strive to get it all done, what’s a typical day look like for you?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> It’s so different every day! The last few months have been crazy with deadlines. Most often, my day means multitasking: Dipping into tenders, putting first drafts together, liaising with the technical teams. I’m constantly engaging with people to see how bids are progressing, what’s outstanding, where our drafts are. I’m definitely one for picking up the phone!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like the most consistent element of your role is that it involves a lot of moving parts! What other challenges have you been faced with so far?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> When I joined the business back in July, I actively took on the challenge of evolving our bid process. It’s really a culture change in how we bid—pursuing the absolute highest quality of bid over quantity of bids. We spend time ensuring the project strategically fits our business and assess our chances of winning it. We’ve built in extra time to review content and stay organized by setting deadlines. The team I work with in the Midlands has done a great job in adopting it, and it’s already led to some incredible wins.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool to see that hard work paying off. What have you learned from evolving that process and getting the team’s buy-in?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> That no one can win a bid in isolation. It’s a team approach, engaging the right people and sector specialists. It’s truly as simple as communicating with people from our various offices, following a bid plan, and keeping everyone engaged throughout the process.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like those recent wins are for some impressive projects. How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I think about all the lives our work touches, and how we’re able to improve the buildings they use every day. For example, a new student accommodation project we’re starting soon will mean university students can have access to central, comfortable accommodations here in Birmingham. I think about all the students from elsewhere—they will now have a place in the city center to call their own while they are here to do their studying. That can really make all the difference for someone!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So true! Through this work, you have the potential to positively influence so many lives. On the flip side, what at MGAC | RLF has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> It’s helped me grow my confidence, massively. When I returned in 2021 after working for a much bigger company, I realized I felt empowered to spearhead the bid improvement process because I knew I had the team behind me. And today, I’ve seen the difference those improvements have made. It’s really incredible. We’re tendering projects that, 10 to 12 months ago, we never would have thought we’d tender.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That must feel so rewarding.</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> Absolutely. To see us be awarded these high-profile projects has been brilliant. And not because it’s just myself, but because the team is treating tendering differently now. The quality of the bids is improving, and we’re all so engaged and eager to win work.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You’re so enthusiastic about the work you’re doing here at MGAC | RLF. What’s the source of that energy?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I’ve always been really career-driven. I think it’s hereditary—my mom was in a senior post in her career. Our work ethics have always been strong. Today, I’ve got a little boy, and he is my world. Now I have another reason to do it!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How wonderful. How old is he?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> He’s 5…going on 15!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Haha! You’ve certainly got a full plate. What’s your secret to winding down at the end of a busy day?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I’m a massive podcast listener. One of my favorites is Fearne Cotton’s Happy Place. She’s a UK journalist and TV persona, and she interviews a different guest every Monday. It’s basically all about people having honest conversations.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> We’ll give that a listen! What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> A strong cup of black coffee!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> We’ve talked a lot about your personal and professional motivations. When you think about the legacy you’re leaving behind, what do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> That I tried my best—from both a work and personal perspective. I think it’s as simple as that. I hope people say, “Whatever she went for, she gave it 100 percent, every time.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Next, we’ve got a round of rapid-fire questions for you.</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> Ask away!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in five words or less.</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> Challenging, rewarding, creative, solution-driven, innovative.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> Check emails.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And the last thing?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> Check emails!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Ha! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> My son’s Minecraft cards and bouncy balls.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> If I’m starting the week “right,” it’s a salad. By the end, it’s a burger!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> It has to be Instagram.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> For me, it’s pretty straightforward: I hope I can continue to develop a team that grows our business. In short, engage in tenders and win bids!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>AH:</strong> I honestly don't think there’s anything they don’t know about me. I’m an open book!

<a href="https://mgacinnervoices.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MGAC Inner Voices</a> is an interview format podcast where a diverse mix of employees are interviewed to share their perspective on challenges they have faced in the A/E/C industry as a result of their identity—including race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, sexuality, ability, etc. By discussing the experiences of our staff, our hope is that their stories will have newfound and powerful resonance with the audience—both to comfort others in similar situations and to encourage those in positions of power to bring about positive, actionable changes to workplace environments for all A/E/C professionals, regardless of their identity.

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Beth: Hi, and welcome to "MGAC's Inner Voices," a podcast where we dig into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry, brought to you by MGAC. I'm Beth Scully, residing in Seattle, Washington. I'm a senior project manager. We want to preface the podcast by saying we're not experts in all things, diversity, equity, and inclusion. I can speak to my lived experience and do my best to help our guests share their experiences as well. Our goal is not to be an expert on diversity, but rather we wanna share our stories and figure out how together we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry and beyond. Today, I have the great pleasure of speaking with Nilesh. And I've had the pleasure of both working with him and chatting in preparation for today's podcast. Nilesh, can you give us a little bit of your background and tell us where you are, your name, your position, all the important details first?

Nilesh: Sure, Beth. It's my pleasure to be on this podcast. My name is Nilesh Jain, and I work as a scheduler at MGAC in our Washington, D.C. office. I am working more than two years with the MGAC. And as a professional background, I've been in construction industry for over five years. I'm a civil engineer and holds a master degree with major in construction engineering.

Beth: Highly qualified. So, to delve right into our podcast, you and I had an earlier conversation together. And after speaking with you, I really had my eyes opened to what you quietly and I would suggest but most bravely have gone through outside of work. Can you let our listeners know a little bit about what your life has been outside of work?

Nilesh: Sure. As an Asian and immigrant, it's been a wonderful journey in the U.S. And I'm living my American dream, to be honest. However, you know, or sometimes there are a bit of difficult situations. I wouldn't say everyone is like that, but there are few people that might not be accepting immigrants as everyone is. So, I have faced some difficult situations outside my workplace. Someone might say, you know, "Go back to your country," and all that kind of stuff. But, you know, it is what it is. But it's been my honor and pleasure to be in the U.S. and work with such great people.

Beth: So, I know that you've experienced various things outside of work. And I wonder, have you ever discussed that kind of treatment with any of your colleagues at work?

Nilesh: To be honest, I don't because working in the U.S., I have learned a lesson. Here, people are mostly professional and they would like to keep their personal life out from the work-life. That's what I learned from my personal experience. So, I don't share my stories with my colleagues, but I do share with some people, some of my friends. And reaction, to be honest, they get angry. But at the end, I have to deal myself with all this situation.

Beth: Yeah. Well, I know we spoke about the genesis of this podcast and the importance we felt of bringing some of these situations forward because it's quite easy, as you're saying, to keep ourselves highly professional and to engage with our colleagues on that level and only that level. But as colleagues learn what you experience in life outside in the world on the streets, I think it will bring us off the bench, if we're on the bench, and stir us to think about how we can be allies, right? So, I appreciate your sharing some of what you experience outside of work. And hopefully, that will stir some of your colleagues to maybe get curious and ask you about your life outside of work, right? But I'd like to pivot the topic a little bit. You and I also spoke, and I know that my eyes were wide opened about your trying to get your Green Card. When you and I spoke, you enlightened me a great deal on something I knew very little about. Can you outline and share with us the process that you're going through, specifically as an Indian?

Nilesh: Sure. So, first of all, I'm on F1 visa, that's a work visa. So, you get work visa on a lottery basis. You do not get based on your qualification. So, you get three attempts to go through the lottery. And if you're lucky, you get picked and you can work in the U.S. So, it's all on luck. Second thing is you just get H1 visa for six years. And once that exhausted, you have to leave country. If you don't wanna leave country, you have to apply for Green Card before your H1 visa gets expired. So that's the process.

So, to get a Green Card to stay in the U.S., the process is pretty tedious. First, you need to get a sponsor who is willing to sponsor your Green Card, and there are very less people out there or employer out there who want to sponsor in construction industry specifically because it's a lot of money and it's a lot of administrative efforts. First of all, it's very tough. Second is Green Card, for an Indian-born citizen, is a very, very tedious and very cumbersome because to get a Green Card for Indian-born citizen, it takes about 20 years. However, on other hand side, if you were born in Nepal or if you are born in UK, you can get a Green Card in three years. So, it all depends on where you were born, and it doesn't depend on your qualification or anything. And, you know, it was not in my hand to get birthed in India. Again, it's on your faith, it's not on your qualification or any hard work.

Beth: Right. It was very illuminating to me that as an Indian-born person, you have to go through this 20-year process.

Nilesh: Yeah. And another part, the toughest part is in this 20 years, the current timeline is 20 years, you have to renew your H1 visa every three years. So, if I decide to go and visit my parents, I have to go to U.S. consulate every time to get my visa stamping if I'm in the renewal process. And another part that I would like to add is when the H1 extension renewal process is in place, you cannot travel between March to September outside the U.S. If you decide to travel, you might be stuck and you don't get the extension. The same situation happened with me, where my mother had an heart attack in March 2020, and I couldn't go to see her at all. And she was in hospital for almost a month. So, I couldn't go because of this all visa process, and you cannot travel if the visa is in process.

Beth: That is gut-wrenching to hear, that, you know, your heart longs to be with your mother, but because of this extended and very difficult process, you are not able to travel and to be with your family at a time when most of us would, that's the very place we wanna be, right?

Nilesh: Yeah. And Indian culture is a little different. People who might have visited India have seen it. But Indian culture is more family-oriented. We have like 50 cousins, whatnot, you know, so we are very family-oriented. So, it's more disturbing when this such event happens and you cannot visit your family member.

Beth: Of course, of course. And how do you feel that that whole process continues to affect you personally? I mean, your courage is amazing to me, and the fact that you get up every day and go to work and do such an amazing job. And I've seen your work and I've worked with you, so I know how brilliant you are. But how does this affect you? And where do you summon the courage?

Nilesh: To be honest, working in the U.S., it's like a dream. You think about your goals, and there are ways to achieve those goals. And people are very kind, very supportive here, and very motivating. So that gives me courage to forget about all the negative things and go for the positive things. Talking about how it affects my personal life, renewing my visa every three years is very tough. For example, down the line five years, if I decide to have family, kids, and they're to go to preschool, if I get, you know, some problem in my visa process, I have to go back to my country. And this has happened to many of my friends. Their kids were about to go to school, but because of this visa process, they have to go back to India or their country. And again, because of this uncertainty, even if I decide to buy a house or any property, I cannot buy because I don't know if I'm gonna stay in this country for a long time. And you get certainty once you get Green Card. But to get a Green Card, it takes 20 years, and I'll be 50 by that time.

Beth: Well, and I think what's important to call out is that, at any point along the way, as you're building your career through no fault of your own, the carpet can get yanked from under you.

Nilesh: That's correct.

Beth: Yeah. I wanna just sit with that for a minute and let people absorb the kind of courage that takes to every day get up and give your best effort and do your best work knowing that because of this visa process, it could be yanked out from under you at any point. And I just wanna express to you during our podcast here, my great admiration for you for...

Nilesh: It's my pleasure. And I'm talking on behalf of a lot of people.

Beth: I know that. And thank you for doing that. And some of the other things that we talked about were all the positive things we could showcase.

Nilesh: Definitely.

Beth: And I'd love for you to talk about your work in the AEC industry and how it's been strengthened and showcase some of those finer points here.

Nilesh: Sure. You know, I would like to add something. You know, America is supposed to be place of freedom, it's supposed to be place of hope. It's supposed to represent land of free and home of brave. And I have lived my American dream here. I have perceived my lot of goals here. It has changed me positively in my professional life, in my personal life. And people here are so great. They are motivating, they accept new ideas, they hear you, they respect you. And it's my privilege to work in the U.S. with such a great people. Every single people matter to me, and I'm grateful to them. Talking about my career how it has strengthened, well, I came to the U.S. to learn skills that I couldn't acquire in my country. And I have learned a lot, you know better. I'm the one who integrated Power BI software in our project control crew. And my manager was completely welcoming to that idea. And he encouraged me. And today, we are very successful with that. We got multiple project because of that integration. I'm absolutely grateful to be working in MGAC and with such a great people.

Beth: Yes. And we are the recipient of your great work. I mean, you know, we've got a client that just looks forward to those reports. And, you know, as you and I were working on one of the schedules, you showed me what else, the power of what you've built for other clients as well. I am sure that we are the benefactors more than you benefit. But I wonder if we can sort of talk about why diversity, equity, and inclusion is important in a workplace?

Nilesh: Yeah, definitely I would like to touch base on that. You know, diversity, it increased a lot of great variety of solution to a problem. Everyone is coming from a different culture, so everyone has different perspective. So, we have a different solution for a single problem. So, this brings a lot of advantage to a company. With diversity and inclusion, everyone gets more tolerant, everyone gets more creative and respectful, and that's a great point. I would also like to add, diversity has boosted American industry, right from Albert Einstein to the current Elon Musk. It's all win-win situation. So, I definitely encourage diversity and inclusion in all company. And especially, I would like to mention in at MGAC, cost and risk is the most diverse group. And I'm absolutely honored to be the part of it.

Beth: So I wonder how does your unique identity make you a strong asset to the team, and how does it inform who you are, professionally?

Nilesh: Coming from Asia, I bring different ideas to my team. I have different perspective. I have worked in India for two years, so I have different perspective. So, I bring those perspective. I keep them in front of my colleagues, and we discuss on them, and we implement on it if it's really good for our team. I would just sum up and say that diversity and inclusion is definitely good or healthy for an organization, and it should be promoted.

Beth: Well said.

Nilesh: And I am absolutely thank you for you guys to initiate this diversity and inclusion at MAGC. It has given everyone's different perspective, and everyone is hearing stories that are not heard. And I'm absolutely honored and humbled for everything you guys have done.

Beth: Trust me when I tell you we are the ones who are so grateful for you, for your courage to come forward and to share your story and to speak your truth. It's profound and we learn together and we grow together. So thank you. Appreciate that. So, if you...not that you're not young because you are, if you're giving advice to a very young person, think of yourself when you were very first starting, what advice would you give them to pursue a career in the AEC industry, and might be worried about facing discrimination?

Nilesh: Are you talking about giving an advice to an immigrant or in general?

Beth: To an immigrant.

Nilesh: Yeah. I would just say, you know, to an immigrant that be what you are, do not fear anything. If you think you are correct, just speak up and don't be afraid of discrimination, you know, face it because it's the part of world. It won't eradicate in a day, it would eradicate eventually, and you would be responsible to eradicate that. So, don't fear discrimination, just fight it.

Beth: Awesome. Awesome. And what does a more diverse AEC industry look like to you?

Nilesh: You know, IT is the third-highest GDP contributor to the U.S. and it's the most diverse industry. So, if you get most diversity in our industry, we are gonna be more successful.

Beth: Yeah. So, you just see it broadening the capacity to be more...

Nilesh: Diversity.

Beth: Yeah, the diversity. So, for coworkers, for example, that are listening to this podcast and saying, "Oh gosh, I never knew what he experienced outside of work. I never knew what his process was for getting his visa, and ultimately Green Card," how do people best become allies?

Nilesh: You know, most of the immigrants here don't have families. And talking about visa process, it's just a government thing. You know, it's something that's not easy controlled by an individual like us. But all we can do and hope is support us because immigrants matters, I think. And, you know, coming far 1, 000 miles away or 10,000 miles away, we just expect, you know, everyone be kind and be respectful, and we are just like you.

Beth: Be just like us, and what I'm hearing is that involve you in our families. Family as you said is...

Nilesh: Exactly. That's what I was trying to get is we don't have families, so we expect a family here.

Beth: Yeah. And so we can all open our eyes and include you in all of our families. I would be delighted if you came to Seattle to include you in my family. Count that a genuine honor. So, is there anything else you would love for our listeners to hear, to ponder?

Nilesh: I would just like to add that it is my absolute pleasure. And America has given me a lot. People are extremely kind, supportive. Right from my master's to MGAC, I have been fortunate that I didn't face a lot of discrimination. And I was supported by many people, that is why I'm successful. I wouldn't say successful, but...

Beth: It's okay.

Nilesh: You know, at least trying to be on that path. And I'm thankful to everyone who supported me in this journey.

Beth: Well, again, we wanna express our gratitude to you for coming forward to participate in our podcast. And hopefully, what we've done by sharing your story is encourage somebody, encourage somebody who needed to hear about your journey and encourage people to become better allies for folks.

Nilesh: Definitely.

Beth: Thank you so much.

Nilesh: Thank you, Beth.

Beth: That concludes this podcast of "MGAC Inner Voices." Thank you so much for joining us. And please, check back next month for another episode of Inner Voices. Until then, take care.

<h4>The Embrace Breaks Ground in Boston Common</h4>
[caption id="attachment_5205" align="aligncenter" width="2560"]<img class="wp-image-5205 size-full" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4718_edit-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2128" /> (Left to Right) Artist Hank Willis Thomas, Public Art Manager Sam Giarratani, and MGAC’s Kris Collins.[/caption]

On April 27th, we celebrated a major public art commission and public memorial project breaking ground in Boston Common, Americas oldest public park. MGAC is proudly serving Hank Willis Thomas’ studio, Songha &amp; Co, to manage the business efforts including planning, fabrication, and installation of <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/king-boston-the-embrace/224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Embrace</a>, a 20’ high 65,000 lb. bronze sculpture that will be the first memorial project in decades inside the Common.

Hank Willis Thomas is teamed with <a href="https://edit.massdesigngroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MASS Design Group</a> for the commission sponsored by <a href="https://kingboston.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Boston</a> and <a href="https://www.tbf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boston Foundation</a>, and the sculpture is currently being fabricated by <a href="https://www.wallawallafoundry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walla Walla Foundry</a>. Installation is expected later this year with a grand opening to the public planned for MLK Day 2023.

The sculpture is in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King and represents the photograph of them embracing and hugging. Last Wednesday’s groundbreaking took place on what would have been Coretta Scott King’s 95th birthday.

&nbsp;
<h4>Kingdom Fellowship AME Church Opens to Public</h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5206" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kfame_01.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="700" />

In 2006, Rev. Matthew L. Watley had a vision to launch Kingdom Fellowship African Methodist Episcopal Church in the cafeteria of a local high school. Since then, the church has grown and expanded to include 5,000 members and subsequently outgrown its place of worship.

MGAC’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrhurley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Hurley</a> had the honor of providing project management services for the development of a 53,000 SF building containing a state-of-the-art sanctuary, chapel, worship support, fellowship hall, and community space. Over the weekend, the church held a Consecration Service to change the ordinary building into a House of God where they plan to continue to worship.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamela-tremblay-a0778558/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pamela Tremblay</a>, Project Manager at MGAC.

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Pamela!</strong>

<strong>Pamela Tremblay (PT):</strong> Thank you! It’s good to be here.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Tell us what you do here at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I am a Project Manager at MGAC, based in our Toronto office.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And when did you first join the company?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I started about nine months ago, so I'm still pretty new!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And how have the past nine months been?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> They’ve been great. I love the entrepreneurial aspect of MGAC. There’s so much opportunity to get involved. Previously, I was at an architectural and engineering firm, and there were just a lot of processes and procedures, rules, and boxes to check. I was really more interested in making my own rules and making the work more efficient, so it’s exciting to have a more hands-on role now. In the first interview at MGAC, I could tell the firm really cares about its people and puts them first. And I really liked that—and have seen it to be the case.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s great to hear. You mentioned that you hadn’t always been in the project management space. Can you walk us through how you got to where you are now? Did your younger self imagine yourself in this role?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> No, haha! When I was a very young kid, I actually wanted to be a cashier. And then my parents said, “Well, maybe you should go to university.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Cashier—that’s a first for this series! What had you set your sights on next?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> In Montreal, there are two years between high school and university. I started looking into operation management, but then I decided to keep all the doors open. I was all over the place! I did a bachelor’s in economics. Then, I moved to Toronto because I wanted to improve my English, as I grew up speaking French in Montreal. When I moved, I went back to school to learn English, and then I ended up going into project management at Ryerson. So, that’s how I got here.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Sounds like you ended up in a role that suits you well!</strong>

<strong>PT: </strong>Yes! Project management really fits me well. Looking back, I think I could have been whatever I wanted, but operation management and project management are very close. So it's what I was interested in all along. I think no matter what I would have done, I probably would have ended up exactly where I am.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Awesome. And what’s keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I have been writing a lot of management plans, which is interesting. We’re early in the planning phase of everything with this work, so we’re offering consultation on project controls and getting into everything that comes before construction. And I’m teaming up with our master scheduler a bit. He’s been teaching me a lot about the software and how to schedule-manage there. I also have a couple of clients on my own that are keeping me busy. I’m generally working on three to four projects at the same time on the client side.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Can you tell us about some of those projects?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> One of my main client is Canada Post. They are renovating and building new facilities throughout Canada. It’s everywhere from Vancouver to Ottawa to Montreal, and we are working on their execution and management plans to ensure the whole process is efficient.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And do you get to use your French with the Montreal work?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Of course! I have been speaking a lot more in French with clients than I thought I would. A lot of them are in Montreal; a few of them are in Ottawa. So, that’s been fun. And it’s interesting because our work comes with a lot of specific terminologies, so I feel like my “work French” is actually something I am still working on!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That makes sense! Beyond that, have you encountered any big challenges in your work so far?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I think mostly just adjusting my pace to the pace of the clients. Some of the work moves quickly, whereas other work—especially governmental—requires layers of approval, so the timing is going to be different. That’s important from a scheduling and planning perspective.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Sure. While you’re still early in your time with MGAC, do you have a sense yet of the impact you hope to make on the firm?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> What comes to mind is my team here in Toronto. We're still growing, and the idea is to keep going! I really want to be part of that. I want to bring in projects and find great people that we can add to the team. We’re at a great growth point right now, and that’s really exciting. I want to be a part of it all.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s wonderful. And what have you found to be most rewarding about your work so far?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> It’s great to know that I learned something new, I scratched things off the to-do list, and to hear that the clients I am working with are happy.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Definitely! And what gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I think a few things! I think I am generally a very positive person, so that helps. I love to have to-do lists, and scratching things off that list always gives me energy. And then great teamwork energizes me. We all work well together and that always gives me energy to keep going. I start out with a lot of energy, so I don’t need much. That said, caffeine helps too!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Sounds like you’re in the right industry then!</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> For sure!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> With all that energy, do you have a secret for winding down at the end of the day?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Well, I have two young children, so after the workday and caring for them, I don’t need a lot to wind down! At that point, I’m pretty tired. I just put my head on the pillow, and I’m done!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> No kidding! What kind of activities are they involved in?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> So, Charlie, she goes to gymnastics, she dances, and she has piano. And then there’s Milan. He’s two years old and he loves dancing. He’s so funny. He always wants us to put on music, and then he wants us to dance. He’s always making a little party. Yeah, so they are always keeping me very busy.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Love it! Do you have a secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> I like waking up early and creating my to-do list, so I know exactly what I want to accomplish during the day. I'm very organized and structured, so that’s an important thing for me. In the morning I am also getting the kids ready for school and off to daycare. When they have a good start to their day, that helps me have a good day of my own. It’s definitely tougher if the baby is crying and not wanting to go to daycare or if we are running late. So starting off on the right foot with them helps so much.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That makes sense! Do you have any favorite books or quotes that have made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> There are definitely some favorite quotes that come to mind and that have stuck with me. My father has a garage, and I grew up around cars and in that environment. There is a Henry Ford quote where he said, “Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs." I find that this is exactly what project management is. It’s dividing all the scope of work into small work packages.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! That’s a great one.</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Another I like is Thomas Edison’s “Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” I feel like it's so true. People really miss opportunity because it looks like they have to work for it. And yeah, I like that. I think I have a work-hard, play-hard personality.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Love it! Ok, next, we’ve got a round of rapid-fire questions for you. You ready?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Yeah!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How would you describe your job in five words or less?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Dividing stuff in small parts.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> You’re starting the workday. What comes first?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> My to-do list!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And last?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Cross things off!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Makes sense! What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Toys, for the kids. If you look in my purse, it's full of little trucks and crayons and dolls. Sometimes I put my purse down and then it starts making noise, like a teddy bear talking or something!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Haha! What’s your go-to work lunch?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Depends! I like to have lunches with a lot of different people. I'm really good at keeping in touch that way. So I’m usually out to lunch at different places.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s great. What’s the most-used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> Probably Microsoft Teams, followed by the daycare and school apps for my kids.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> At MGAC! Maybe as a VP!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Awesome! What’s something your colleagues don’t know about you?</strong>

<strong>PT:</strong> That I was a professional dancer when I was younger, until I was injured. That’s one other thing I thought I would be when I was younger!

<a href="https://mgacinnervoices.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MGAC Inner Voices</a> is an interview format podcast where a diverse mix of employees are interviewed to share their perspective on challenges they have faced in the A/E/C industry as a result of their identity—including race, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, sexuality, ability, etc. By discussing the experiences of our staff, our hope is that their stories will have newfound and powerful resonance with the audience—both to comfort others in similar situations and to encourage those in positions of power to bring about positive, actionable changes to workplace environments for all A/E/C professionals, regardless of their identity.

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[Beth: Hi, and welcome to MGAC's "Inner Voices," a podcast digging into issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the architecture, engineering, construction industry. Brought to you by MGAC. I'm Beth Scully, residing in Seattle, Washington. I'm a senior project manager. And a disclaimer, we wanna preface this podcast by saying that we are not experts in all things diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a person who identifies as a cisgender, I can speak to my lived experience and do my best to help our guests share their experiences as well.

Our goal is not to be the end-all experts on diversity, rather, we wanna share our stories and figure out how together, we can create better outcomes for all of us in the AEC industry, and beyond. Today, we have the pleasure of speaking with... And I'm gonna say this, I want you to introduce yourself because it's a topic that we're really addressing today. And I think it will be really important for you to say your name loud and clear and all of us to hear it.

Stanislava: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. My name is Stanislava Dobreva. I'm based in Los Angeles. And I'm currently working as a project engineer at MGAC.

Beth: I appreciate hearing your name right out loud, Stanislava. And one of the interesting little details we found out, I don't wanna steal your thunder, was that you are Bulgarian born. And I was able to share with you that my sister-in-law was also from Bulgaria, so we had fun talking about that. But let's dig right in. And how about you tell us your story, and a little bit about the importance of your name, and even your journey with your name.

Stanislava: I'm Bulgarian. So, I have a pretty traditional Bulgarian name. I was 8 years old when I moved to the UK with my family. And that was, actually, when I started primary school, and I was asked to change my name because of how traditional and difficult to pronounce it was to children at the time. So, that was when I had to pick an alternative name, which at the time I had chosen Delphine.

And from then onwards, from the age of 8 until probably the age of...when I graduated secondary school, so about 18, I carried this different persona. At the beginning, because I was so young, I didn't really realize or care so much about it until when I got older. I thought about it a little bit more, and I was just like, "Well, there's no really need to do that. People should be able to pronounce a pretty simple name." And, you know, looking back in hindsight, thinking about a primary school asking a student to change their name is just shocking to me at this point.

Beth: Yeah. And so, it wasn't until you actually got to university that you took on your name, your given name, right?

Stanislava: Yeah. So, when I finally registered for university, I used my given name. And then from then on introduced myself as Stanislava, although there were still people at university and since then, who asked me how to pronounce it, and whether I do have a nickname. But I'd say that more of the time now, I pronounce it slower for them and tell them that it's, "Stanislava."

Beth: Now, we can sit, and you can say, it really is kind of ridiculous that they asked you to change your name because it's not that difficult, really. And as far as diversity, and inclusion, and equity, as you think about that experience today, do you feel like having to go by a pseudo name rather than your given name, that...I don't wanna put words in your mouth, but did it alter you, or your path, or did it cause a life in your home versus a life at school?

Stanislava: Yeah. Definitely, there was a difference in how my family and close friends would address me because honestly speaking, I have a different nickname in Bulgarian, which because of the way endings change in the names, it's difficult to explain it to a foreign person and expect them to understand it and to use the appropriate ending for that nickname based on their conversation. So, I think that had an impact on the nickname that I chose.

I don't know if it would've changed my path, but it's confusing for a child or a person. It's just like, "Would you introduce yourself for someone else's convenience, or do you just continue using your given name?" But, you know, at the time, it wasn't something I paid attention to. It's only now, in hindsight, that I look back, and I'm just like, "Wow. Well, there was no need to do that." I don't know how much of a bit of an impact it would've had on my actual life. It's just confusing. I think that's just the most simple way to put it.

Beth: So, a tender question for you. Would you now as an adult, and obviously, you know, you are a project engineer, you are a person in your own right, with a really great education, can we name it for what it was, discrimination?

Stanislava: I would say there is a sense of exclusion with it, of course, because your actual self is not being accepted in its pure form. You have to change it to suit other people. So, when you look at it that way, I would say it's a level of discrimination.

Beth: Having spoken with you prior, I know that your mom is also a very accomplished woman. She's a doctor. I wonder if we might delve into that a little bit because it's also part of the story here.

Stanislava: She is a very hard-working woman. She had some difficulties initially when we moved to the UK, which, again, you could call discrimination. She wasn't initially accepted as a doctor. Her degree wasn't accepted straight away. It was only when Bulgaria joined the European Union, that her degree was accepted, and she was able to go ahead and work as a doctor. But in the process, because I think it was about five years from us when we moved there to when Bulgaria entered the EU, she was working towards getting her degree acknowledged and accredited. So, she was doing all the placements, and the exams, and all of that. But it definitely would've saved her a lot of time and effort if it was just purely accepted like it was five years later down the line.

Beth: Yeah. Yeah.

Stanislava: Very frustrating.

Beth: It's very frustrating. And I know that since you've come to the States when you and I spoke, you felt like discrimination in the UK was more present than here in the U.S. Am I recalling that correctly?

Stanislava: I can only speak for California. I haven't really had the opportunity to visit many other places, but everyone here has been pretty accepting. And, you know, several times when people have asked me for my name, if I see that they're struggling, I would even say, "You know, you can call me something else if it's easier." They would say, "No, no, it's fine. I can pronounce it. Just repeat it slower." So, they do make the effort, and I feel like, it's more accepted here.

Beth: It's a little bit different having lived in LA. Also, it is a very open community and also very diverse as well.

Stanislava: Yeah.

Stanislava: If your very early years are having to adapt to something else, do you feel, as a woman, in this industry, that you've had to adapt?

Stanislava: Well, that's a great perspective, actually. I didn't think of it that way, but I consider myself to be pretty adaptable and resilient. So, maybe that did have an impact. I've never really thought about it, but it makes sense.

Beth: It's interesting, isn't it, right?

Stanislava: Yeah.

Beth: We have sort of these experiences and, perhaps, we look back, and go, "Huh." You know, I've always thought of it as just my ability to do this, but I feel like, as a woman in the industry, sometimes that there are adaptations I've made. And I wonder how you are able to now use your unique identity as your strongest asset.

Stanislava: Well, you know, I actually think, in this industry, you have to have a level of emotional intelligence and be able to read people. And I think that's one thing that I really rely on. I feel like, I'm pretty good at reading the room. And I'm a relationship-space person, so that really helps me problem-solve and deal with certain situations because I'll address it in a certain way using my relationships, and always kind of try to put myself in their shoes, or how they would feel. And then that helps me get to the bottom of an issue, or think of a way to approach something to resolve an issue.

Beth: Yeah. I think that's a really profound skill to have, especially when people are coming to the table perhaps with a poker face, your ability to read a little bit deeper and put a different spin on things, maybe turns the tables a little bit, and really helps you when you're client-facing, or working with people in the industry.

Stanislava: You've really got me thinking now about how that simple...well, not simple, I shouldn't say that, but that experience may have really shaped my path, like you said. So, this has been insightful for me. Some people judge people by their name. With recruitment, for example, there's been times where I'll apply in the construction industry in the UK for a position. There's no reason why I shouldn't go for an interview, or get to the next stage because, on paper, I'm ticking the boxes, you know? It just makes me wonder, is it because of my name? Is it because I'm a female?
I feel like, the U.S. is a lot more accepting of women in the construction industry than the UK. And I feel like, there's more potential for growth here in terms of leadership and getting to a higher position in the construction industry, as a woman, than there is in the UK. That's also a big thing for me. When I did my dissertation in my bachelor degree, and in my master's degree, they were different topics, but they were both based around women. One of them was, "Women in the Construction Industry." The other one was, "How Women Use Value Networks to Gain Credibility." So, you know, I'm very interested in how your name, or how your identity plays a role.

Beth: Yeah. I think, especially in our industry as women, we face it a lot. I'm interested to kind of delve in with you a little deeper that you feel more acceptance, as a woman, here in the U.S. And yeah, I think of all the women that have gone before us to pave the way, right? And I had the privilege of interviewing Jacqualynn Karsten. And I don't know if you heard that interview or not, but she was definitely out there paving the way. As you think about these things, what does a more diverse AEC industry look like to you?

Stanislava: Well, of course, I'd say even more women in leadership. I have had lucky experiences where I haven't really been discriminated, in that sense, apart from, as I said, in interviews or not getting into a certain position, maybe because I am female. But I don't think, specifically, LA is lacking much. I don't wanna talk on everyone's behalf, but I would just say not to judge women on their gender and their ability to manage a project, quite simply, because I don't think that's anything to do with it. So, it's a male-dominated industry. Women have a different perspective as well on how they problem-solve and how they see certain situations.

Beth: Yeah. I always like to ask our guests on the podcast, for you, how can your coworkers who may not have a personal experience of having someone literally try and alter their identity by, "Hey, change your name. It's hard for me to say it." Or as a woman facing discrimination, how would you advise your colleagues, your coworkers to be an ally?

Stanislava: Just don't judge anyone on a name or a gender. I would just say, just try to be accepting, and just put yourself in someone else's shoe before you make a judgment. Because I feel like everyone has a story, which at work, you would never really find out about, or, like, has been through a journey, which you wouldn't necessarily hear about. So, it just helps to be accepting of everything and everyone.

Beth: Well, I know when you and I spoke, we both referenced the TED Talk that we had heard at the lunch and learned about how people have had their names altered. It's always been our hope as we share these podcasts that suddenly, people who know you, Stanislava, and know that now, you faced this same kind of discrimination as a child and you were asked to alter who you were, that the story becomes very personal. And the impact of that is like, "Oh. It's not it doesn't happen to somebody I don't know, but it's my friend, my colleague, Stanislava, whose name got altered." And so, I just wanna thank you for sharing that very personal story and for being willing to open up, and tell people, "Yeah. Hey, it impacted me. It changed me." And maybe you're even on a journey to think about how it changed you more than, perhaps, you had thought about, right?

Stanislava: Definitely. You've opened my eyes even more now. And I'll be...I mean, in Los Angeles fashion, self-evaluating.

Beth: Awesome

Stanislava: And that could have impacted me.

Beth: Awesome. Well, I wanna thank you for being part of our podcast. It's really been a privilege to chat with you. I hope I get to see you soon, in person. And just thank you so much for sharing your story with us today.

Stanislava: Thank you for the platform.

Beth: That concludes this podcast of "MGAC Inner Voices." Thank you so much for joining us. And please, check out next month for another episode of "Inner Voices." Until then, take care.

Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-tran-b4607487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Tran</a>, Senior Health &amp; Safety Consultant at MGAC | RLF.

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Welcome, Matt! We’re excited to learn more about you and your work at MGAC | RLF.</strong>

<strong>Matt Tran (MT):</strong> Hello! It’s great to be here.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s your title, and what does your role look like on any given day? </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> My title is Senior Health and Safety Consultant. But in many ways, that only tells half the story. The bulk of my work is to fulfill a role we have on every project in the UK, the “principal designer” role. This involves managing the design team in the pre-construction phase of a project and coordinating with them to eliminate out all of the foreseeable risk in the design. We’re essentially making the completed building as safe and easy to maintain as possible. So a large part of what we do is design risk elimination work, which is effectively hazard management. Then, on the other side of my role, I advise the client in a safety capacity and physically go on to the construction sites. We carry out safety inspections, audit contractors’ paperwork, and provide reports to the client directly. The regulations we work to are known here as ‘CDM’ which stands for Construction Design Management. This gives you a broader insight into what the bulk of our work involves.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Interesting! Were you doing similar work before you came here?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I was! I was doing the same job for a smaller firm in London. I’d been there for five years, and I was at a point in my career where I was ready for growth—a larger firm with bigger projects and new challenges. I wanted to get into a place where I could work hard and move up the organizational structure. I was attracted to our firm because it had all these things, in addition to being multi-disciplinary and having a great culture.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And when did you join the team? </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> That’s a funny story. I joined on the 16th of March 2020. Of course, we all know what March 2020 means. I started on a Monday, and everything was pretty good. COVID was in the news, and it was past the point where everyone thought, “This thing is never going to come here.” They were starting to let people work from home, just in case. But by Tuesday—my second day on the job—everyone was called into the conference room and told we were all going to work from home until further notice. So I was sent home with a laptop, and all of my training was from home. I barely knew how to work the systems and hadn’t met half the people at the company yet!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Wow, what a first week! </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> It was an interesting time. Usually, when you join a new company, you get to settle in and have time to learn by observation. This was more like baptism by fire!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Safe to say you needed to hit the ground running. It’s great you already had experience doing this work. Was this always a field you wanted to work in when you were younger? </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> When I was a kid, my career ideas were a bit all over the place! I always loved diggers, tractors, and machinery. So the fact that I'm in construction now is fitting. But at the time, I liked the idea of driving them, perhaps as a builder. Later I thought about being an actor, and then a journalist. Ultimately what persuaded me to earn my degree in construction was the 2 weeks work experience I completed with a chartered surveyor when I was 15. I found it to be quite interesting. Plus, I knew there would be a lot of opportunities in the industry. Construction is booming. There’s such a demand for housing, office space, all the things our services can deliver.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It sounds like your kid self would think your job today is pretty cool. </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> If you were to tell me as a 10-year old, “You’ll be working in London, involved in the construction industry,” I think I'd be very proud of myself and maybe a little surprised.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What keeps you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I’ve got one particular project I've been on since I joined, Audley Square House. It’s a prime luxury apartment development in Mayfair. And when I say “luxury,” we’re talking next-level. These apartments have sculptures and fountains and private pools fit for a king. It will be a significant part of the London property portfolio when it’s constructed. It's been on site for 18 months. At the moment, we’re digging five levels underground and have hit basement level four. Below ground it will have car parking, pools for all residents to access, a spa, salon, and gym. It’s got everything.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Sounds like it! What an exciting project to bring to life.</strong>
<strong>
MT:</strong> Absolutely—it’s something really special. Another project I’m newly working on that will be incredible to see come to life is in Birmingham. It’s a significant redevelopment that’s part of an overall regeneration plan. It includes shopping markets, leisure facilities, cultural buildings, and a new hotel, to name a few. The plan is that it will provide approximately 51,000 new homes a ton of new office space and 100,000 new jobs. I’m working on just a section of the overall redevelopment. It will be like a new city within the city when it’s complete.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That sounds like a great opportunity to work on a project that’s positively impacting the community around it.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Absolutely. It feels very rewarding and satisfying to feel like you’ve made a difference and you’ve contributed to something that’s improving the lives of people in a community and helping to level up the country.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What challenges have you been faced with so far in your role?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I’d have to say COVID, mainly. I came to the company, and overnight all of my sites have shut down. We needed to work out a plan in real-time. Based on guidance from the government and Construction Leadership Council, we helped these building sites put things like social distancing markers, hand sanitizer points into place. We were turning these sites upside down to make them COVID secure, getting all the PPE. It was a huge challenge, and it reset a lot of our projects in a way that demanded a different perspective and way of working.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Certainly a challenge, to say the least. What did that experience teach you?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I think dealing with that very real-world experience has given me the confidence to handle ongoing challenges. Obviously, we get project challenges with design issues, people asking for advice. For example, a client might want a fabulous marble floor. But it’s slippery, and it doesn’t meet safety recommendations in its current form. It’s our job to help find the solution so that the Client achieve their desired finish. Perhaps we add a coating that improves the slip resistance—but doesn’t compromise the beauty. You’re also looking ahead to the next 10 years. Is this an asset that can be managed, cleaned, maintained efficiently?

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Right, so there’s an element of foresight and anticipation involved.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Exactly. Because the design team is sometimes focused on how it looks rather than how it works. They don’t always pick up on things like, if there is no guarding around the roof for design purposes, the client is going to have to put in a harness system for the guys who clean the windows and maintain the plant equipment. That’s our job. After all, every building needs to be cleaned, and the more complex the design and shape, the more difficult it often is to clean. I think about New York and all its skyscrapers. At some point, someone thinks, “You know, those windows are getting pretty dirty. How are we going to clean them?” Take the spire on the Chrysler Building. I suppose that's a hassle to get up and clean occasionally!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Safe to say, most people don’t think about who cleans that spire! </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Right! But buildings need to be thought about in a functional sense, rather than just in the use sense. It’s funny. When you work in this role, it changes how you look at things. When you walk by a building, you don’t see the whole building. You see its components—and what it takes to maintain them.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> It’s clear this work has shaped the way you view the world around you. What about MGAC | RLF has made the biggest impact on you?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Working here has presented me with challenges that have helped me grow. Because of COVID, the first few months were a big challenge, to say the least. It was quite the test. But I had the confidence to get through it. In many ways, I’d say it brought out the best in me. When you succeed, that gives you more confidence. And that’s still the case today, ongoing. I appreciate that the management here gives you a pathway to help you grow your career. They give you the tools to do the job well, and then the license to go on and get on with it.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And what impact do you hope to have here?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I'm relatively early in my career; I know I have a long way to go. I aim to keep myself humble and always willing to learn. But I’ve also been working long enough to know not to worry about asking stupid questions. And I understand the value of having an open mind and collaborating with peers. For example, if there’s knowledge I can pass along to younger colleagues in the office, especially in an area where I’m particularly knowledgeable and can give perspective, I’m eager to do that.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s great. What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> As a health and safety risk management guy, it’s really my job to make sure everyone goes home safely at night and the buildings we help design are secure. So just in fulfilling my role, I should be helping to make the industry a safer place. I find that incredibly rewarding.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy to do that work each day?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Having balance. Once I finish work for the day, I love to disconnect and do something active like go to the gym, playing golf, or spend time with my girlfriend, Chloe. Having a productive private life gives me the motivation to give 100 percent the next day at work. For me, energy comes from that balance and making sure everything is where it needs to be.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> That’s a great outlook!</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> We all know that if you overwork yourself, stress creeps in, and you can start to dread work. I make sure that I set clear objectives, and even deadlines, to do things for myself. I want to give tomorrow’s Matt the easiest start to his day that I can.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> On that note, what’s your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> English people and tea—it’s not a myth! The first thing I do is make a mug of tea.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Name a favorite book.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I’m a huge fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books by George RR Martin. Away from fantasy I also like books about tech pioneers as it’s fascinating to read about how their minds work and how they seek to shape the world. The two main inventors that interest me are Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How about a favorite quote that inspires you?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> “Face your fears and live your dreams.” I was told this years ago by a friend, and I’m not even sure who originally said it. It resonates with me in regard to work. We are often worried about what might happen, like an overwhelming presentation or meeting, but when you face a fear head-on, I find it’s never as bad as you think. And when it comes to living your dreams, I find if you have an ambition in your mind of what you want to achieve, and work out how you’ll achieve it, you can make it happen.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s a great one! And applicable to many situations.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> It really is, and if I never remember who said it, maybe I’ll pass it off as my own quote!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What do you want your lasting impact to be?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> To feel like I made a difference and had a positive contribution to all the work I was involved in. Because it's not always obvious–if you walk past a fantastic new building, often the credit goes to the developer and the architect. But you know from being on the project that you had a big role in how the building ultimately feels and functions. People often take safety for granted. But if no one knows about our involvement, that’s probably because everything is working as it should—there are no design flaws or accidents. So that’s a good thing for us. And we know that it was a job well done.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely! Now, we have a few rapid-fire questions for you.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Okay!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Make a cup of tea.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the last thing?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Plan ahead for the next day to give tomorrow’s me the best conditions to work in. And…probably make a cup of tea after that!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> A pair of $100 bills. It’s actually a funny story.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Do tell! </strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I’ve got an uncle who has lived in America for over 30 years. And his favorite brand of tea is English Red Label from a supermarket here called Sainsbury’s. Every time he comes to visit, he loads his suitcase with tea until it’s bursting at the seams. And any time I visit him, I bring him more. If he’s running out and no visits are ahead, I ship him a massive box of tea. I did that last year, and he sent me a Christmas card with $200 inside because the shipping costs were enormous—especially compared to the value of what I was sending! Needless to say, even the British abroad can’t do without their tea!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Haha! What a great story. On the topic of food and drink, what's your go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> There’s a place I've been going to for over 5 years in Shoreditch High Street. There are food markets everywhere and one stall does a grilled chicken and rice box. It includes salad, halloumi cheese, and a drink for just £5. It’s so cheap, but the quality is really good and I have introduced quite a few people in the office to it.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What's the most used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> WhatsApp.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Describe your job in five words or less.</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> Remove risk. Safety first.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What's something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> While they probably know that I love food, they might not know that I'm a passionate cook.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Nice! What’s a recent recipe you made?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> The other day, I cooked beef wellington. It’s not actually as difficult to make as you’d think!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> We’ll take your word for it! What's your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>MT:</strong> I want to have a positive impact on my projects and meet my objectives. And also to make the most of—and truly appreciate—being around colleagues in the office. For years, we took that for granted. But it’s such a special thing to be able to go out and get lunch, or just sit down and talk about a project.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Welcome to the Impact Blog, Sarafina!</strong>

<strong>Sarafina Klopfer (SK):</strong> Hi, thanks for having me!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Tell us what you do at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I’m a project manager working in our Commercial and Corporate sectors. We manage anything from helping a client complete change orders to navigating a ground-up build. We can start with nothing more than a budget and location and help see a client through the real estate procurement process all the way to handing over the keys, or we can come in mid-project and help a client achieve very specific milestones. We have the ability to work from project conception to completion, so to speak!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What brought you to MGAC, and what were you doing prior?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I was working as an on-site project engineer for a construction company. I realized that what I enjoyed most about the job was the people aspect, and that’s what brought me over to the owner’s rep side.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Makes sense! Did you study engineering in college? </strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I did. I studied industrial and systems engineering at Lehigh University.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So was this line of work always in the cards for you? What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Not exactly—when I was younger, I wanted to be the president! I knew I wanted to lead people, more than anything. It wasn’t until I got into high school that I realized that math and science were my strengths. Combining those with my knack for the leading people eventually led me to construction, which on the GC level is extremely team-based. Because at the end of the day, you’re working and collaborating with other people to build a building.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Absolutely—and it sounds like your role now is the perfect fit. On that note, what’s keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I just spent 2½ years working for a government defense contractor building and renovating Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF for short). In total, our team touched more than 10 sites around the country, so I did a lot of traveling and met with some incredible people. We essentially served as their in-house project management team. As soon as their real estate department solidified a lease, it was handed over to us. We were writing architect RFPs, general contractor RFPs, furniture RFPs, managed consultants —whatever was needed to complete the project.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow. 10 projects in 2½ years—that’s no small feat!</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Absolutely. And a lot of these were quick turnarounds. All came with valuable lessons about working on the government side of things, which was new to me. In particular, it was interesting that, like any other project, you’re keeping the end-user in mind—but on this kind of work, you don’t really know who that is! We were building the infrastructure of the space, but for security reasons, we were understandably kept in the dark about the specific end-user. Instead, all kinds of cryptic names were used.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Wow. Safe to say security considerations were also taken into account with the design?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> That’s right. I learned a lot about that, as well. For example, there are no windows in these spaces. Because nowadays, there is technology that can use the vibration of light in a room to record conversations.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Fascinating! So now that those projects have wrapped, what’s next? </strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I recently joined a team that’s building a global headquarters in Baltimore’s waterfront area. In total, the project involves redeveloping a 50-acre campus, while the headquarters building itself is 280,000 SF. Right now, we’re grading, and the foundation for phase 1 is going in. The headquarters piece breaks ground later this year. The client is striving for a Net-Zero building, with a target opening date of early 2025. When it’s completed, it will be one of the largest mass timber buildings on the East Coast.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> So, in a short time, you’ve traveled the country delivering government projects and started on a major HQ a short drive from your home base. When you think about all you’ve done and will be able to accomplish here, what impact do you hope to have?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> No matter what project I’m working on, I strive to lead with empathy—it’s an important skill in our line of work. To me, empathy is about much more than asking, “How was your day?” It’s about understanding what makes each client tick and adjusting my project management and leadership style accordingly. That could mean customizing communication to a client’s preference, or diving into even deeper detail in presentations. Ultimately, it’s all about understanding your client and how they work. I hope I can help others recognize that and also lead by example.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Well said. What challenges have you been faced with in this role?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> MGAC’s project management style is very proactive. Our whole approach is to put a lot of work in on the front-end, so we can anticipate a lot of those challenges. But in the past two years, that just hasn’t been possible. That said, we certainly still do get ahead of the curve on issues and resolve them. But as soon as you do, there’s often a new supply chain issue or labor shortage around the corner—something you never would have been able to predict. That’s kept us on our toes. I think this has actually been an important growth opportunity for the construction industry as a whole, which tends to lag behind others when it comes to technologies and DE&amp;I. We’re an industry that’s very set in our ways. So the past two years have really shaken things up. Anything you thought wasn’t possible, now has changed.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How so?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Take contract writing. Given the unpredictability of material lead times, some projects are no longer afforded the time to finish design prior to going out to bid. There is more of an effort to complete drawings and specifications for MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) and roofing, trades not commonly included in initial GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price) packages. Clients and agencies who haven’t typically procured via a GMP are being advised to consider an early contractor engagement process to avoid a major schedule impact. Specific contract language is now being included to account for unprecedented world events, and it is our job to help the owner weigh the risk of these new contract clauses. Being proactive is essential to protect our clients.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And all the more reason to have an owner’s rep on your side.</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> No doubt. What’s cool about MGAC, in particular, is that we all work on such diverse projects. Private projects might be dealing with things differently than I am in the Commercial sector; the same goes from one industry to another. We’re always sharing information across the company and learning from each other—and our clients are the ones who ultimately benefit.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you learned as you’ve navigated all these unknowns?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I'm someone who loves to plan everything out, and my job very much relies on that. But the last two years have humbled all of us and taught us that, sometimes, no amount of planning can tell us how the market will react. Things we once felt we could rely on are no longer assured. So, I’m learning to be agile.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Aren’t we all! What at MGAC has made an impact on you?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> The people. There’s such a breadth of backgrounds that brings people into project management. That contributes to us having such unique perspectives. Here, you’re never working on a project alone. As I mentioned earlier, there’s so much collective knowledge. People are quick to send an email requesting advice, because you know someone will have valuable insights. MGAC attracts a lot of hardworking, dedicated people, and we’re all willing to take the time to share our experiences.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> We’ve talked about the impressions you aim to leave on your clients and colleagues. How do you hope your work will impact your community at large?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> So much of the work we do is a once-in-a-lifetime project for our clients. As an employee, it’s not often you have your entire office renovated or your headquarters relocated. I hope our clients can come out of the experience with a new appreciation for construction and the difference it can make in our lives.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What have you found most rewarding about your job?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Seeing all your effort executed and brought to life. Going back a few months later and seeing someone sit at their desks beneath a light that you spent months laboring over the positioning of.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What gives you energy?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> There’s a quote that comes to mind: “If not you, who? If not now, when?” I often realize I have the power to make my day—or to not! That really inspires me. There’s no one out there handing me my future. I’m the one who has to put in the work.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What is your secret to winding down at the end of a long day?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Taking time to be outside by going for walk, just releasing some steam.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What about your secret to starting the morning off on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I enjoy starting the day with a workout and a cup of coffee. It clears my head.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Now, we’ve got a few rapid-fire questions for you. Ready?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Yes!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What’s the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Open my email and check my calendar.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s the last thing?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Check my calendar again.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s the weirdest thing we might find in your desk or work bag?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Pre-Covid, I had such a variety of shoes under my desk. I’d typically walk into the office in flats, and then switch to heels. On a job site, I’d wear work boots. And if I’m exercising after work, I’m lacing up a pair of sneakers.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s one of the most used apps on your phone?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> The app that I use more than your average individual are weather apps. I grew up in Hawaii, and never once checked the weather—it’s pretty much always beautiful! When I moved to the East Coast, I became fascinated with the weather patterns. So today, I use weather apps to track storms around the world.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Interesting! Describe your job in 5 words or less.</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Identifying and implementing creative solutions

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s your biggest work goal for 2022?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> Successfully navigating my current client transition, moving from a fast-paced TI fit-out with multiple projects across the country to engaging with a larger team on a single project.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I got asked that five years ago when I joined MGAC, and I couldn’t have described the opportunities I have been afforded to date! Hopefully, continuing to grow within MGAC and mentoring younger project managers.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s something your colleagues don't know about you?</strong>

<strong>SK:</strong> I was born and raised in Hawaii, but my family is Swiss. In fact, my entire extended family is in Europe. I grew up speaking German at home, and English is actually my second language!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Getting there is a matter of a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between day one and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. We’re revisiting them as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. Today, we go Behind The Build and revisit our work with <a href="https://www.wistonestate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiston Estate Winery</a></em>.

Steeped in tradition, the South Downs wine story is one that dates back over 2,000 years. Home to a range of chalk hills that stretch from Winchester in Hampshire, the limestone soil and sun-soaked slopes create a landscape that’s perfectly suited for growing grapes. In recent years, winemaking in the region has received growing international acclaim, earning Sussex wine official legal designation on par with Champagne and Prosecco.

Nestled in the heart of West Sussex is Wiston Estate Winery, a magnificent estate that has been owned and managed by the Goring family since 1743. In 2006, the family planted grapes to produce wine. A little over a decade later, 2019 brought a record harvest, and the Gorings set out to expand their winery's footprint. And so our work began. The goal: increase production capabilities from 120,000 bottles a year to 250,000 and bolster the visitor experience in the heart of the winery with new retail, wine tasting, and café offerings on-site. To make that all happen, we were engaged to provide bank and fund monitoring, building surveying, cost management, health and safety, and project management services.

<h4>FLINT BARNS, TURKEY FARMS, AND FINE WINE</h4>
Wiston Estate Winery has a storied history, one that is very much alive today on the grounds. It was important to the Goring family to preserve and enhance that history throughout the refurbishment project. There was a careful balance to strike in showcasing heritage assets while weaving in contemporary elements that extended the estate’s remarkable hospitality to more visitors for years to come.

With sustainability and authenticity at the heart of the project, plans were drawn up with exceptional care—and creativity. Through diligent restoration to flint walls, oak beams and handmade clay tile roof, an 18th-century threshing barn, once used as a turkey farm, would become the property’s new dining destination. Demolition of dilapidated storage buildings would allow for the recreation of the historic courtyard at the heart of the site, while extensions and alterations to actively used wine production buildings would allow the winery to grow alongside its flourishing customer base.

The construction work to make it all happen would be extensive and wide-ranging. It spanned demolition, civil works, heritage refurbishment, steel frame building construction, extensive public realm, and large-scale commercial refurbishment works.

<h4>CONTRACTS, COORDINATION, AND LOTS OF COMMUNICATION</h4>
This was, by every measure, a big job. More challenging yet? It needed to happen on an actively producing site. To make that possible, we advised the client to split the work into multiple construction packages and administered and controlled a total of eight works packages.

The assembled project team was commensurately diverse to the task at hand. <a href="https://www.ecearchitecture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECE Architecture</a> spent 18 months drawing up the plans for the work. <a href="https://www.hop.uk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hop Consulting Limited</a> oversaw structural engineering with <a href="http://deltagreen.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Green</a> as M&amp;E engineers. <a href="https://dowsettmayhew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dowsett Mayhew</a> served as a planning consultant. Quite a few consultants were brought on board, as well. <a href="https://manorwood.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manorwood</a> served as the heritage consultant and contractor. <a href="https://www.cheesmur.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheesmur Building Contractors</a> completed the main bulk of work, with <a href="http://www.landbuild.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landbuild</a> completing the complex site groundworks. All of the demolition contracting work was overseen by <a href="https://www.hughesandsalvidge.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hughes and Salvidge</a>. Throughout the project, a handful of additional contractors were brought in, and at the height of construction, there were as many as five contractors on the site at any given time.

Managing multiple contractors was one of the biggest challenges to navigate during the project. Knowing the importance of each role, it was one we took very seriously. We started every day with strategic conversations and kept them going until the day’s end. It proved to be critical coordination that kept everyone on the same page.

<h4>CHANGE OF PLANS, COVID, AND A CHRISTMAS DEADLINE</h4>
Construction projects can be unpredictable—and sometimes, nature is the culprit. An unexpected bumper harvest took us by surprise and called for a major change in plans. It required storage of hundreds of thousands of bottles of wine—and fast. To save the product and protect the client’s assets, we worked swiftly to re-sequence the procurement strategy to ensure a new building could be built in time. Some 250,000 bottles later, you could say the team pulled it off.

As with many projects over the last couple of years, COVID entered as a major unforeseen factor. Managing the risks related to contracts and keeping everything moving on schedule and on budget was critical throughout the height of the pandemic. Then came the next challenge: opening the doors to a new restaurant by Christmas 2021. As a way to invite guests to enjoy the seasonal produce from the estate and nearby producers, the creation of the Chalk Restaurant and Tasting Room was a central component of the property renovation plan. Due to its historic nature, it was also one of the most complex jobs to tackle.

Working with heritage assets is something that must be done with care by experts. What’s more, this project aspired to not only incorporate these materials, but make them central to the design and the eventual guest experience. Original elements were exposed and highlighted, while those in need of replacement were locally sourced and crafted as they historically would have been. As is often the case with renovation builds, there were surprises along the way, but having the right team on the ground and a carefully devised plan kept things on track. Chalk opened its doors on December 7, 2021, to a full dining room.

<h4>CREATING AND BOTTLING AN EXPERIENCE LIKE NO OTHER</h4>
At its core, this project centered on commitment. Our project team's commitment to delivering excellent work while not disrupting winery operations. Commitment to an end goal that empowered us to swiftly pivot—and sometimes, pivot again—when forces beyond our control demanded a new approach. Our client's commitment to breathing new life into the estate and ensuring guests will have an experience to remember for years to come.

Wiston Estate Winery is a home for some, a place of employment for others, and an invitation for all to experience the beauty and bounty of the South Downs. We felt that hospitality every day on the jobsite, and are thrilled to know we had a hand in ensuring more people can share in this special place.

Earlier this month, we attended the <a href="https://www.sussexheritagetrust.org.uk/about-the-sussex-heritage-trust-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Sussex Heritage Trust Award Ceremony</a> where the Wiston Estate Winery received an award in the Commercial category. Those of us who work in this industry know it takes a lot of work to create an experience that feels effortless. The production of fine wine is no different, each bottle the prized product of dogged diligence, educated experiments, and countless recalibrations. When someone is able to simply savor the moment, and never once contemplate all that went into it, you know you've pulled it off.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sourced from <a href="https://constructionexec.com/article/the-whole-nine-yards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction Executive</a>

<em>August 3, 2022</em>

Every construction project aims to be one-of-a-kind. High-rise buildings, concrete and austere on the exterior, might feature unique layouts on each floor. Hospitals and shopping centers might display brightly colored tiles. Office buildings might punch things up in the kitchen with exciting cabinets or add movement to workspaces with standing desks.

While each of these nuances enables individual buildings to shine, it’s still difficult to find a construction project that is truly out of the box—a hospital still needs to function as a hospital, an office building must possess the components of an office building.

So, a project for which the owner has allowed a company true creative freedom would really be something.

Enter NFL Los Angeles, the National Football League’s newly completed West Coast headquarters, which serves as the home of NFL Media. It made sense to shift NFL media operations—already located in Los Angeles County, in Culver City, since 2003—to the city of Los Angeles, a global media hub and home to two NFL teams: the Rams and the Chargers. Stan Kroenke and the Kroenke Group contributed the land and the stadium to the NFL’s project, making it downright serendipitous when it was completed in August 2021, just in time for the NFL’s 2021 season, which culminated in the Rams—also owned by Kroenke—winning the Super Bowl right next door, in their own SoFi Stadium.

The tenant fit-out for the NFL began in November 2020 as part of Kroenke’s $5-billion Hollywood Park mixed-use development, NFL Los Angeles had two main project phases. First, <a href="https://wilsonmeany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilson Meany</a> and <a href="https://www.pankow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pankow</a> delivered the base building and superstructure for the project. NFL Media, which includes NFL.com, NFL Network and the NFL app, claimed four of the building’s seven floors, as well as an additional story in the basement. Then, general contractor <a href="https://www.howardbuilding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard Building Corporation</a> built the interiors. <a href="https://www.mgac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MGAC</a>, a project management and consulting firm, and <a href="https://www.gensler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gensler</a>, a design and architecture firm, completed the interior of the build, bringing the NFL’s vision to life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The past several years have been a period of significant growth for MGAC, which is now 50% larger than it was at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. Today, the firm has a third of its staff working from four new offices across the United Kingdom. With this growth comes new opportunities, and we are pleased to announce leadership changes to strengthen the company and its management team.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hay-a08a12b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Hay</a>, a 15-year veteran of MGAC, will become MGAC’s Chief Operating Officer. In addition to his current role as Managing Director, which includes overseeing several of MGAC’s domestic offices, sectors, and services, Steve will take on the additional responsibilities of overseeing and managing the firm’s Human Resources, Information Technology, and Administration teams, ensuring successful operations as MGAC continues to expand its offices and client base.

“I am humbled at the opportunity to expand my role and look forward to supporting and integrating our global operations teams to position MGAC for future success,” said Steve Hay. “Having seen MGAC’s growth since 2007, I am extremely excited for the opportunities in the future and look forward to expanding our footprint internationally and domestically.”

We are excited to announce <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandragrande/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandra Grande</a>’s promotion to Chief Marketing Officer where she will manage and grow the firm’s Marketing team, working seamlessly across our ten, soon to be eleven offices worldwide. Sandra has played an integral part in the success of MGAC’s recent acquisition in the United Kingdom, and continues to lead her team in executing firmwide internal and external marketing and communications efforts.

“When I joined MGAC, I quickly embraced the firm’s entrepreneurial spirit and have had the privilege to expand our marketing efforts at a global scale, working alongside a team of extremely talented professionals,” said Sandra Grande. “Today, this team spans eight time zones from the United Kingdom to the West Coast of the United States. I am excited for all that is ahead and look forward to further expanding our capabilities in my new role!”

Our Founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-g-anderson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Anderson</a>, will continue to lead the firm. In addition to his role as President, Mark will become Chief Executive Officer (CEO). As President and CEO, Mark will formalize his activities in more of a strategic role where he will be focused on the next “big moves” for the firm, as we continue to position MGAC for future growth and success.

“The character and nature of business is changing, and MGAC is and will remain at the forefront of our industry, doing the best work, with the greatest clients, when results truly matter,” said Mark Anderson. “Providing the best structure, support, and professional opportunity for our colleagues as we grow the company is foremost on my plate.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Please join us in welcoming <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wemhaner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Adam Wemhaner</strong></a>, MGAC’s newest Senior Vice President. Adam comes to the firm with more than three decades of experience, having worked as a senior construction executive on both the client and contractor ends of a project.

His work delivering innovative and complex builds has taken him across many different sectors and continents. Most recently, he served as Vice President of Construction at Doug Wall Construction, working on business and team development, and providing oversight on estimating, project management, and field operations.

“We’re so happy to have Adam on board,” says Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director <a href="https://www.mgac.com/team/steve-hay-/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Hay</a>. “His expertise and hands-on knowledge of our industry gives him a unique perspective and insight into where the industry is headed and will be instrumental as we continue to grow our West Coast portfolio of work.”

“I’m thrilled to be joining MGAC,” says Adam. “The environment here is truly team-based, and everyone brings a unique skill set to the table. We’re perfectly positioned to deliver the best work possible for every kind of project, and it’s exciting to be able to offer that to colleagues in the industry.”

Adam is quick to credit his energy and work ethic to his upbringing on an alfalfa farm in Oklahoma. He now calls California home, and when he’s not working enjoys getting outdoors and traveling with his wife, children, and grandchildren.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The Impact Blog is a spotlight series that highlights and celebrates the diverse employees that make MGAC tick. Beyond their day-to-day schedules, we want to know how they have a greater impact on their colleagues, their company, and the communities in which they live and work. We want to know what makes them get out of bed in the morning, what led them to their current role, and what they hope their lasting impact will be.</em>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-hatfield-mrics-79b07326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Hatfield</a>, Associate at MGAC | RLF.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Welcome to the Impact Blog, Richard!</strong>

<strong>Richard Hatfield (RH):</strong> Thank you!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Tell us what you do here at MGAC | RLF.</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> I’m an associate director. I manage the national framework for Sport England, and I also work with the education team delivering projects for the University of Birmingham. That’s my main role at the moment. In terms of what I do, some days, I’m a chartered surveyor. Some days I’m a social worker listening to and responding to problems. Overall, it’s looking after the budget for the client to ensure that their project is delivered to expectations, within budget.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> And when did you join the firm?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> It’s been a little over four years now.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What brought you over?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> I’d been at my previous company for a few years, and was ready for a change. MGAC | RLF seemed like exactly what I was looking for: a family-sized business with good opportunities and interesting projects across sports, education, and other verticals. Those leading the firm also really seemed like a really good bunch of people. Both the people and projects drew me to the company.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Makes sense! So did you always see yourself ending up in this industry? What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>
<strong>RH:</strong> It was that long now that I can’t remember!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Fair enough!</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Well, my father was a builder, and I always thought I would go down that route when I was a child. From an early age, I was working on construction sites with my father, just helping out, that kind of thing. He turned to me one day and said, “You don’t want to do what I’m doing; you want to be a quantity surveyor,” and I took his advice.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Sounds like your current job would make sense to kid-you then!</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> I’ve been doing this for about 26 years, and it’s just now making sense to me!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Haha! What kinds of things are keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> I visit quite a few projects for Sport England around the country. I have conversations and meetings related to this work every single day. And there’s a big range: boxing, bowling, cricket, martial arts, even a dojo in someone’s back garden. They do a lot of work with disadvantaged people and children, so that’s really rewarding. Then, with the University of Birmingham, I’m working on the new Molecular Sciences building. It’s fairly large, 80 Million GBP. Quite an intense project that’s been a major focus for the last four years.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Very cool, and a great mix of work. What do you hope your impact will be across all these projects?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> It's pretty simple, really. As long as I am doing a good job, making sure the clients are happy, and getting repeat business, I'm satisfied! For me, knowing our clients are confident with what we do for them is endlessly rewarding. I always appreciate getting a thank you at the end of a project and hearing that someone appreciates you going the extra mile for them.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What kinds of challenges have you been faced with?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Apart from going through the recession a few years back, the challenge I’ve found that comes up the most is juggling private life and work. I have small children, and that causes your focus to shift. But you still want to deliver projects and do a good job at work. Fortunately, at MGAC | RLF, we all have a work team that helps us face challenges on the job. You don't have a whole team to help you at home with new challenges that arise in family life!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>So true! What have you learned about achieving balance?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> It’s all about having an understanding employer in the background. The directors around you are the biggest part of that. I’m always trying to juggle work-life balance, and the last couple of years have been especially challenging with COVID. You’re trying to do your job while making sure your mind is sane, and your kids are happy. One of the biggest things that sets MGAC | RLF apart is that they are very understanding. The work-life balance is really good. Everyone works hard, but the directors around you all have families as well. I appreciate that, thanks to my job, I am able to have a good life outside of work, and I can give my kids a good life.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s great. And how old are your kids?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> They are 8 and 3!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Busy ages!</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Definitely.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Obviously, you have a busy day-to-day. What gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Starting the day with strong black coffee!! I also like to be up before my kids and have an hour to myself in the morning, which means getting up extra early. That’s my time, and I try to fit in some exercise as well. When my kids get up, I make sure they are happy, and I’m set for the day. Also, every day is different at our work, which helps!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely. On the flip side, what’s your secret to winding down at the end of the day?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Turning off everything to do with social media and with computers and, making sure my phone is out of the way. I focus on my children and my wife. We don’t talk about work; we try to just spend quality time and get outside for fresh air. My biggest hobby right now is barbecue.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What are you grilling these days?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> A lot of fish. A lot of long and slow cooks—pulled pork, that kind of thing. Not just the usual burgers and sausages.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Yum! Is there a book that’s made a significant impact on your life?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> There are a couple. The first is Lift Your Vibe: Eat, Breathe and Flow to Sleep Better, Find Peace and Live Your Best Life by Richie Norton. He’s a yoga instructor, and it’s all about the mind, health, diet—everything that helps you get through things, basically. The other one is Feel Better In 5 by Dr. Rangan Chatergee. It’s a really good, simple book, and his podcasts are also great. I like to listen to them every morning on the commute to sites and to the office.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Love it! That leads us right into our first rapid-fire question. Are you ready?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Yes!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> After your commute, what’s the first thing you do at work every day?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Make black coffee! I do that before I even look at emails. From there, I have a general chit-chat with the team to see how they are, and then I fire up the computer.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s the last thing you do before ending your workday?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Check the train times. I have to be back home by a certain time to pick my kids up from childcare, so definitely check the train times!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Do you have a go-to weekday lunch?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Leftover barbeque food. A lot of people in the office are quite envious when I open my lunchbox!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> I bet! What’s the weirdest thing we might find in your work bag or desk?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> I don’t do weird! I like things to be straightforward and simple.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s the most-used app on your phone?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> The Peloton app.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> How would you describe your job in five words or less?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Challenging, budgets, interesting, varied, stressful.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> What’s something your colleagues don’t know about you?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> That I’m actually blind in one eye. And that I’m nearly 50!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC:</span> Big birthday ahead! And where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

<strong>RH:</strong> Still doing what I’m doing. Having more family holidays. More adventure.

This month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-g-moloney-1b093125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Moloney</a> takes us on a tour of <a href="https://raymondeducationcampus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raymond Elementary School</a> in Washington, DC. The project includes renovation work to two 1920’s buildings, demolition of a 1960's building, and a new building addition to ultimately create 85,000 GSF of modernized learning space to bring it in line with the District of Columbia Public Schools (“DCPS”) Educational Specifications (“Ed Spec(s)”).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Getting there is a matter of a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between day one and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. We’re revisiting them as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. Today, we go Behind The Build and revisit our work with the <a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/american-geophysical-union-agu-headquarters/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Geophysical Union (AGU)</a>.</em>

Here at MGAC, we have always known that a building can be so much more than brick and mortar. In 2013, that very idea inspired the leaders at the American Geophysical Union (AGU), a not-for-profit scientific organization dedicated to the advancement of earth and space science, to undertake a visionary, precedent-setting project. At the time, the space AGU had called home for two decades was aging, and the organization faced a decision: find something new, or put in serious work in order to stay put. They saw an opportunity in that second option and the board of directors commissioned a study of their 62,000-SF, circa 1994 headquarters building to see how they might be able to take the existing structure into the future. If they could pull it off, AGU would be able to use their space as a daily demonstration of their own unwavering commitment to sustainability. And with that idea in mind, the project—and our work—began.

<h4>A PASSION PROJECT BACKED BY A PASSIONATE TEAM</h4>
AGU’s mission is of “advancing science and its power to ensure a sustainable future” served as the cornerstone of the work throughout—and that work certainly was cut out for us. Early on, the goals we’d be working toward were laid out plainly: we needed a space that was every bit as inspiring and hardworking as team AGU, and, on the technical side of things, we were shooting for a building that would be Net Zero. In other words, the total amount of energy used would need to be less than the amount of energy created on-site. We would be the first in D.C. and the greater Mid-Atlantic region to attempt this through a renovation project.

Building for Net Zero, in any circumstance, is no small feat. In a renovation build, it’s even harder. And, when you’re the “first” to do anything, that work carries a high profile. In every way, the bar was set high, and reaching it would take giving it our all, every day.

At MGAC, we’ve been known to take on a challenging project or two, but what drew us to this one, in particular, was the energy, the excitement, and the passion AGU brought to the table. They could have easily moved into a new office building or made baseline functional renovations to their headquarters to keep things status quo. Instead, they saw an opportunity to make the moment mean something, not only for themselves but for others. Ultimately, they hoped that by doing this work they could create a blueprint for other organizations to follow suit, to be able to say, “If we can do this, you can too.”

Knowing we’d have the honor of playing a role in creating a greener future was all we needed to champion the cause ourselves. We were all in, and fortunate enough to work alongside a great team who shared that spirit. Hickok Cole was the architect. Interface Engineering served as the engineering team. HITT Contracting served as GC. It was by every measure a solid team, made stronger by a shared commitment to the work.

<h4>A BIT OF LIGHT READING AND INNOVATIONS GALORE</h4>
For this project, our team was engaged to provide <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/project-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project management</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/cost-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost management</a>, <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/technology-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology solutions</a>, and <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/ff-e-procurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FF&amp;E procurement</a> services. Wrapped up in all of this work was the inherent, sweeping novelty of it all—estimating for, scheduling for, overseeing, and meeting the needs large and small for things that simply hadn’t been done before. Getting that right meant we needed to understand—and appreciate—the many moving pieces of the project. Since our team isn’t one that stands on the sidelines, we really had to roll up our sleeves from the jump to meet a pretty massive learning curve.

To pull off the Net Zero goal, a lot of hyper-technical, remarkably inventive things needed to happen. The list of <a href="https://www.agu.org/Building/Pages/Learn-About" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innovations</a> is a long one, but there were a few that were particularly ambitious. The five-story building is outfitted with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1Xd1YtnFgQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 1,000 SmartGlass windows</a> that can self-adjust tints as a response to sunlight to optimize natural light and energy. The entire footprint of the building is covered in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfA90i-7e8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photovoltaic panels</a>—something never before seen in D.C. Those 700-plus PV panels create a direct current that can be delivered to low-voltage devices, like LED lights and laptops. Stormwater collected on the green roof helps supply the restrooms with water. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2py1kZD2HBs&amp;list=PL7Ihm2Mh3MZ5TggfwsjA6XSJnfa1l4bK6&amp;index=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-story hydroponic green wall</a> works with the building’s HVAC system to reduce energy loads and improve air quality. And, to top it all off, we needed to tap into the city’s circa 1890s sewer lines as a method for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUzguD-fPgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heating the building</a>.

We’re often diving into the unknown in our world, but this project is certainly one that came with extra homework. Behind AGU’s passion for the project was serious study. In the interest of documenting the process, the team had authored dozens of white papers on all the science behind the build. To ensure we understood all the moving parts—why each innovation was worth the time and cost, what was needed to make each happen—we spent a great deal of time on-site with the thought leaders at AGU, asked lots of questions while meeting with vendors and, yes, read quite a few white papers along the way. We even wrote <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/achieving-net-zero-sustainability-and-energy-consumption-in-the-built-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own</a>. In the end, that extra work enabled us to bridge key conversations between architects and civil engineers, window installation teams and green wall experts, contractors and data scientists.

<h4>LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED</h4>
Beyond the technological and mechanical implementations meant to reduce energy consumption, reclaiming and reusing existing materials was a key piece of the sustainability effort. All of the existing furniture was cataloged and assessed for reuse viability. Beyond that, virtually every object in the space—everything from doors and cabinetry to fire extinguishers and frieze panels to exit signs and toilets—was evaluated for reclamation. Whenever possible, existing materials were given a new life in the renovation. Some pieces returned to their original use, others found new homes within the five-story building, and some underwent larger, more creative transformations.

Whereas most project teams working on new restroom facilities wouldn’t think twice about disposing of old toilets, in this build, the porcelain itself was viewed as a valuable raw material. Today, fragments of that porcelain can be found in the lobby terrazzo flooring and within the tabletop of the headquarters’ main conference room. Also in the lobby, visitors will see a stonework compass rose that was preserved and re-installed into the floor. On the exterior, roughly 5,000 bricks were saved and cleaned for reuse in the renovated walls. Items that didn’t find a second life in the renovation were donated when feasible.

<h4>IF WALLS COULD TALK</h4>
Perhaps one of the most unique features of the completed project is the space’s ability to take visitors behind the scenes of the build. In many ways, the walls do talk—and they have quite a lot to say.

Visitors can follow a thoughtfully designed tour route that displays the space’s Net Zero features. The lower level of the building, in particular, offers a fantastic opportunity to see the inner mechanics of the headquarters at work with data displays that update in real-time.

In every way, the building displays a delicate and successful balance between science, design, and function. It exists as a beacon for sustainability and progress. It raises—and pushes further—the conversation on green building practices. It’s won <a href="https://www.agu.org/Building/Pages/Tour/Awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awards</a>, it was <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/dc-mayor-signs-historic-clean-energy-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognized by the mayor</a>, and its blueprints and teaching materials are being used across the globe so that others can confidently take on ambitious green builds. It’s impossible to overstate the impact this one project will have on the future, and we are so thankful to have been a part of it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>WASHINGTON, DC—September 2022—</strong>Leading project management firm MGAC has been selected to manage the redevelopment of 20 Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington, DC (<a href="https://www.mgac.com/projects/20-mass/262">20 Mass</a>). This new mixed-use destination in the Capitol Hill neighborhood is expected to reach completion in Spring of 2023. MGAC is delivering comprehensive project management services on the reimagining and full redevelopment of the concrete-framed office building, originally built in 1973, across the entirety of the asset’s eight stories, two below-grade parking levels, and mechanical and utility systems. The building is managed and developed by <a href="https://www.rmrgroup.com/Home/default.aspx">The RMR Group</a> (Nasdaq: RMR), a leading alternative asset management company. <a href="https://www.dpr.com/">DPR Construction</a> is the general contractor and <a href="https://leoadaly.com/">Leo A Daly</a> is the architect and interior designer for the project.

The building will offer a chef-driven restaurant, expansive retail, a separate office, and hotel lobby on the ground floor. A 271-key Royal Sonesta Hotel will comprise five floors, while Class A trophy office space is available on the top four floors. Additionally, there will be a fitness center on the second floor, a conference center, ballroom, and penthouse amenity with 360-degree city views.

Project features include the addition of three new stories, a 14,500-square-foot penthouse, and a full height and depth bay added to the east end of the building. As part of the gut renovation, openings in existing floor slabs were also added to accommodate two new atria, along with new stairs, elevators, and other core elements to be fitted out for a range of future uses. The west atrium required significant structural reinforcement and the use of robotic demolition equipment to remove the existing concrete floors.

MGAC is overseeing the incorporation of automation features throughout the building, including touchless fixtures, furniture and equipment technology, and automatic doors. Additionally, MGAC coordinated the installation of custom SurePods prefabricated bathroom pods in the hotel component. Manufactured simultaneously with the hotel’s initial construction phase, these state-of-the-art pods maximized efficiency and reduced the construction schedule from a traditional stick-build approach.

“This project is unique in the area for combining historical grandeur with innovative design and experience,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-lee/">Mike Lee</a>, Vice President and Project Manager, MGAC. “We are working closely with RMR and DPR, as well as all stakeholders, to deliver a user-centric development and a distinctive neighbor of the U.S. Capitol, Georgetown Law, and Union Station.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sourced from <a href="https://issuu.com/mannpublicationsmagazines/docs/mr_september_2022_magazine"><em>Mann Report: The Proptech Issue</em> (page 108 of 132)</a>

<em>September 2022</em>

<em>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-l%C3%A9ger-rcdd-8739a44/">Joe Léger</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natelarmore/">Nate Larmore</a>, Vice Presidents, MGAC</em>

One of the primary benefits of robotics and automation becoming more ubiquitous across industries is that it affords teams the time and ability to be more creative and focus on value-add, judgment-based tasks. This is especially true for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries, in which large amounts of time are spent inputting and analyzing project data and tracking and coordinating the supply chain. This time would be better spent on ideation and execution—as well as client relationship management.

In response to the widely publicized labor shortage, materials scarcity, and supply chain delays, robotic process automation (RPA), is becoming a more relied-upon solution in the design and construction of buildings. This innovative program is calibrated to advance how construction firms and the AEC sector approach development, production, and administration operations.

<strong>Why RPA?
</strong>According to a 2022 <em>Robotic Process Automation Market </em>report, RPA is expected to grow at a rate of 16.2 percent and set to reach $47.19 billion by 2029. This is because RPA is finding more enthusiastic adoption in the industry, especially since the pandemic. With implementations put forth to ease manual labor of construction plants and projects, RPA systems aid specifically in back-office operations, allowing contractors to save both time and money.

In this case, as with many others, it isn’t so much that new technology has been developed quickly, but rather that industry experts are finding innovative ways to support existing technology to solve new problems, specifically in the AEC industry. RPA implementation cuts down on manpower through automation, redirecting the focus to examine construction drawings and review materials and equipment. Administrative efforts, such as filing, collecting, and submitting contracts are neatly arranged with RPA, reducing the risk of misplaced paperwork. The use of RPA technology solves workflow problems for all sectors of labor – contractors, architects, engineers, etc., all stand to reap its benefits.

As more professionals are relieved from time-consuming tasks, employee productivity and engagement increase with an ability to focus on being creative and solving problems. When it comes to the supply chain, less time needs to be spent on keeping track of information and more on managing industry relationships and finding new solutions. Purchase orders can be automated and optimized to stay ahead of constraints (as much as possible), and information for invoices can be extracted, input, and processed to help streamline quotes from suppliers. In the realm of cost management for projects, RPA and data analytics help businesses achieve more accurate forecasting and risk management.

As contractors continue to welcome advancing technology, their adoption of RPA holds the potential to completely transform how the industry operates. With the issue of shorter project timeframes while maintaining strict budgets, RPA can automize laborious tasks such as extracting submittals, and use the time gained to focus on project timelines and budget. By capitalizing on RPA’s software tools, immense amounts of data from projects that were formerly left to employees can instead be organized and generated, leveraging data from previous projects to produce predictable and successful outcomes for future developments.

<strong>Challenges and Concerns of Use
</strong>With the central purpose of RPA being to decrease time and cost, while improving quality and productivity, appropriate training programs on the use of RPA software must be instituted for employees. This will not only support effectiveness, but also help avoid inaccuracies in construction projects. From a fiscal perspective, there are upkeep considerations for these tools, including regular maintenance and upgrades for performance efficiency. These considerations should not discourage construction companies from utilizing this program—it's ultimately about properly allocating resources and being disciplined about process.

The industry-wide hesitation to implement RPA stems primarily from uncertainty of job security in the AEC industry. Since the key objective is to streamline repetitive, time-sinking work, there is some fear of people being replaced, but as with other industrialized construction processes, the technology doesn’t replace people but rather enables them to be more efficient and productive. Serving as another tool, industry professionals will learn to use RPA to their benefit, just as they do with BIM, drones, or any other time-saving advances. RPA’s sizeable footprint is continuing to push the boundaries of technological advancements in construction, as well as other industries, endorsing opportunity for widespread application.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Today, we get to know <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexamayewski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lexie Mayewski</a></em><em>, Project Manager at MGAC.</em>

—

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Welcome to the Impact Blog, Lexie!</strong>

<strong>Lexie </strong><strong>Mayewski</strong><strong> (LM): </strong>Thank you!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Tell us what you do here at MGAC.</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I am a project manager here at MGAC. I was actually just <a href="https://www.mgac.com/blog/mgac-q2-promotions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted</a> about a month ago!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Yes, congrats! </strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Thank you! So, I just made that transition from assistant project manager. The main client I serve is the DC Public Schools system, so my summers end up being very busy getting schools ready for students to come in!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Makes sense!</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>It’s busy, but it’s so rewarding. We are making these schools better for hundreds of students—students who will hopefully go on and change the world, which is really cool! So, day to day, I’m pretty much the middleman between the school principal and the construction team. Those two groups don’t necessarily speak the same language, so I’m there translating, making sure that everyone is on the same page and gets what they want at the end of the day.

Right now, I’m involved in a swing space, which is where we transition students temporarily while we modernize their main school. So, I am involved in one of those projects as well as two modernizations—two gigantic projects that are being renovated for the district.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Sounds like you’ve found a great gig! What brought you to MGAC in the first place?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>My story in construction started when I was a Girl Scout, which is kind of funny. When I was 10, I was at a Girl Scout event, and Lockheed Martin was there talking about the need for more women in engineering, and I was like, “Yes, sign me up. I’m going to be a woman in engineering.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Wow! What came next? </strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I was 10 years old, not knowing what any of those words meant, but I always said from that day forward that I was going to be an engineer! As I grew up, I was good at math and science, so it just kept making sense. I went on to study civil engineering in college. I had an internship with a general contractor, who actually hired me before I even started my senior year of college. I was set! It was the kind of company where you’d live, work, and die in the same place, though, and that just wasn’t for me. But, I still loved being able to see a project from start to finish, so I found a different place to do that. That was being on the owner’s side, and I’ve loved it here ever since! It’s been just over a year now at MGAC, and it’s been awesome!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Sounds like you came full circle with your involvement with </strong><a href="https://womeninconstructionconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Women in Construction</strong></a><strong> today?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Yes! I am on the board of directors, serving as the co-chair of the registration committee. I’m a mentor for a small group of fellow women in construction, and I also sit on the scholarship committee, where we award scholarships to high school seniors going to study architecture, engineering, or construction. It’s cool to be a part of making an impact in the industry for women.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Love it. So what’s keeping you busy these days?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Getting my school open! We have 580 students moving from their temporary home to the newly renovated main building. So that’s keeping me busy! As the dust settles there, I’ll be on my way to open schools next summer and then the following summer. In short, I’m busy with schools for the foreseeable future!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Sounds like it! What exciting projects to bring to life.</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Absolutely. One of the schools I'm working with right now is the School Without Walls at Francis Stevens. It has been really rewarding. Their <a href="https://www.swwfs.org/mission-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission</a> is so wonderful, and you can just tell the leadership and the teachers have the biggest hearts and really want their students to succeed. It’s inspiring to be a part of that.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And what impact do you hope to make through projects like this one?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I’m able to know that thousands of students over the next 50 years are going to go through a modern, fully equipped school. I like to believe that our future president is going through DC Public Schools as we speak. To have them breathing clean air, feeling comfortable while they are learning, and experiencing a really cool classroom is a concept. It’s so exciting and is what gets me out of bed every day to do what I do.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s a great way to look at it. Oftentimes with schools, there’s a wider community impact as well. Is that something you’re seeing with this project?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>It’s definitely a major factor. Everything we do spans beyond just the students, and even the classrooms. It’s knowing that parents with baby strollers can attend sporting events. It’s knowing the walk to school is safe. It’s knowing students can ride their bikes. It’s knowing the drop-off time, when hundreds of students are coming through the car line, doesn’t negatively impact the community. It’s thinking about the community garden that welcomes outside members of the neighborhood. The word <em>community</em> is so ingrained into every conversation we have. Every question we ask and everything we do goes back to not only the students, but the community as a whole. Being a real community partner is a big part of the job.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>How cool to live in a place where you’re making a direct impact.</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Definitely. I love being able to see that end product every day. And in 20 years, when I drive around the city, I’ll be able to show my kids an elementary school I built or renovated. Pointing to a tangible product and saying, “I was part of that,” is so cool.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Have you experienced any challenges along the way with this work?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>There are always budget and schedule challenges, but I think the most formative challenge I’ve faced is learning to communicate with people with all kinds of different backgrounds. There are sometimes competing interests in this work, and I love to be the unifying thread on a team. That person who knows everyone, as well as their interests and goals, and is responsible for weaving the team together. In essence, stepping up as the leader. It’s a challenge but also a really unique position, which makes this job so exciting.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What a great takeaway. What else has this job taught you?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I think one of my biggest takeaways, especially with being recently promoted, is that you can be a leader at any level. I wish I could go back five years and tell myself this right out of college. Specific technical knowledge—like knowing the exact details around how a door or a window connects to a wall—doesn’t always matter in the grand scheme of things, because you can learn. Nothing prevents you from asking questions, having opinions, and sitting at the table as part of a team. I think that’s huge and has followed me a lot recently. Having the confidence and knowing that you were hired for a reason and what you have to say matters.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>So very true. What about MGAC has made the biggest impact on you?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>The people. When you walk in here, you know there are brilliant, amazing people around you. Having that all under one roof is incredible. My boss, Elyse Roeder, is a big part of that. Back in December, my best friend passed away. It was so horrible, but knowing that I was taken care of professionally while I was dealing with a loss made such a difference. It’s difficult to fully put into words how much it meant to me. There are just good, genuine people under this roof, and it’s really inspiring.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Absolutely. And what gives you energy each day?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I’m just so thankful to be alive and to be able to wake up whether the sun is shining, or raining, or doing both. It’s just so cool to be here and go do cool things in the world. Or even just sit and drink your coffee. I think that life is just so good.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And what’s your secret to winding down after work? </strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I’m a huge bookworm. During COVID, I started reading so much. For the past two years, I have read 83 books each year. I read like nobody’s watching. No books are safe near me!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s great. Any significance to 83?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>It just happened that that’s what I read the first year, and I was so impressed with myself that I wanted to keep the same momentum. Being a goal-oriented person, I have decided I have to read at least 83 each year now!

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>Do you have a favorite book that you’ve read?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>That’s a hard question. <em>Untamed</em> by Glennon Doyle is the first thing that comes to mind. It’s about living your authentic, truest life. And I just think that what are we here to do except be ourselves and do that every day? It’s just such a cool message.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>What about a favorite quote?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>I love quotes! My best friend, before she passed away, wrote this one down as one of her favorites: “Always believe that something magical is just about to happen.” I have it in her handwriting, and it’s so special to me. To me, it signifies the joy and hope we all need. It’s knowing that even if you’re knee-deep in mud, you’re gonna get home and take your shower soon. Even if you have had a tough day, you always know something better is coming.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s a great one. Do you have a routine for starting each morning on the right foot?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>Ideally, I journal and meditate. Mostly I am setting my intention for how I want to feel that day. Recently, I find myself coming back to the theme of joy. I want to find joy in the small things, and I want to be calm. No matter what challenges construction throws at me, I want to take them on with peace and joy and knowing that it’ll be ok. So, setting intentions, drinking a cup of coffee, and just spending some time with myself before I get into it all.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>And what do you hope your lasting impact at MGAC will be?</strong>

<strong>LM: </strong>There’s a great quote that says, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” If I’m on my deathbed, I want to know that I loved hard in this life. I think that’s all that matters. Long-term, I want people to say, “She loved people, loved life, and was joyful.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>That’s great. Now, we’ve got a few rapid-fire questions for you. Ready?</strong>

<strong>LM:</strong> Fun! Let’s do it.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MGAC: </span>You’re starting your workday. What’s the very first thing you do?</strong>

<strong>LM:</strong> Check my email!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>MGAC was founded with the promise to take on the most interesting and challenging project ideas and make them a reality. Getting there is a matter of a million small steps, countless conversations, a multitude of carefully-calibrated decisions that take place between day one and that long-awaited project delivery day. Those are the moments that make a project. We’re revisiting them as we delve into the ways our talented, passionate team makes each of our projects possible. Today, we go Behind The Build and revisit our work with </em><a href="https://rlf.co.uk/case-studies/the-exchange-building-no3-centenary-square-birmingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>The Exchange at the University of Birmingham</em></strong></a><em>.</em>

[caption id="attachment_5486" align="aligncenter" width="1194"]<img class="size-full wp-image-5486" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-30-at-10.50.45-AM.png" alt="" width="1194" height="908" /> His Royal Highness The Prince George outside the Bank's front door, with the Lord Mayor (Horace Edward Goodby).[/caption]

In 1933, Prince George opened the doors to the old Municipal Bank building for the first time. Sitting opposite Centenary Square right in the heart of Birmingham, the neoclassical building, with its grand columns and formal Portland stone and bronze entrance, would have been impossible to miss. As a place that helped people with modest incomes start savings accounts, buy their first homes, and rebuild their finances following the war it quickly became a cornerstone of the community.

After many years of serving the people of Birmingham, the bank closed its doors in 1998. As time went by, it stood empty. With each year, the Grade II-listed building that was once such a central fixture in the city fell further into disrepair. That is, until 2017, when the University of Birmingham decided to purchase the building from the Birmingham City Council to give it a new lease on life.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5489" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-30-at-11.03.33-AM.png" alt="" width="1204" height="942" />
<h4>EMBARKING ON A PLAN ANCHORED IN PURPOSE</h4>
As is the case with much of our work, the plans for the building were ambitious—and exciting. The university saw huge potential in the building—potential to not only restore its former grandeur, but to use it as a space for members of the university and the wider Birmingham community to gather. Building on its legacy as a place where currency was exchanged and the community was brought together, they envisioned a venue where ideas could be exchanged through public-facing research presentations, data sharing, courses, and events. Translated into site plans, that meant retrofitting what was once a single-use building into a café, event spaces, flexible work and meeting rooms, a roof terrace, and an outdoor courtyard.

The project team who would make all that happen included <a href="https://www.gallifordtry.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galliford Try</a> as the contractor, <a href="http://glancynicholls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glancy Nicholls</a> as the architect, <a href="https://www.macegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mace</a> overseeing project management, and <a href="https://www.wsp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSP</a> providing structural services. MGAC was enlisted to contribute <a href="https://www.mgac.com/expertise/services/cost-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cost Management</a> services.

<h4>DIVING IN AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNKNOWN</h4>
Our first and most critical task on this project was to build a budget that was cautious enough to allow for historical surprises, checked the boxes for key conservation requirements, and enabled us to work toward something really special. Integral to this was our firm’s expertise on historic refurbishment projects and constant coordination with the conservation officer overseeing the work. Once we learned what could—and could not—be done, we tapped our own experience to strategize solutions. Because we’d been here before, we knew those solutions must always account for the unknowns—further wear and tear on the building, highly-specialized tradespeople who might need to be called in for heritage repairs, and more.

From there, we collaborated with project partners to ensure the client’s goals, design plans, and historic requirements could align with the budget available. It was a delicate balancing act, but one that was a real team effort as everyone involved wanted to see this remarkable landmark building restored.

The on-site work began in January 2019. Anyone who stepped in at that time could see that the university had taken on a challenge when it purchased the property. The years of neglect were apparent, making surveying a critical part of laying the groundwork for the project. While some of the refurbishments needed were immediately apparent, there were still many unknowns—and challenges that came with filling in all of the blanks.

When we conducted a survey for asbestos, for instance, we, fortunately, were able to gauge where most of it was, but had to continue to work under the assumption that we may find more along the way. After all, due to the historic nature of the building, we couldn’t simply take apart walls to see what was underneath. Everything was evaluated with extreme care with the help of rot hounds and meticulous sample analysis.

On this project, even the doors were handled with careful consideration. Seemingly straightforward processes like fire tests—which involve burning one of a structure’s existing doors to gauge how long any one of them would hold up in event of a fire—were impossible due to the historic nature of the building. We were dealing with bespoke carved, solid oak doors, so that method was off the table. Instead, the project team underwent a much more involved process that engaged labs to conduct testing that wouldn’t leave a trace.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5480" src="https://www.mgac.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Exchange-Details-44_duplicate-from-RLF-drive-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1708" />
<h4>SPECIALIZED SUBCONTRACTORS, SITE ACCESS, AND SUPPLY CHAINS</h4>
We always knew this project would require the engagement of uniquely skilled craftsmen. When asbestos was discovered in some of the ductwork, it was determined that the plaster ceiling needed to be cut out. That had to be done with extreme care by a subcontractor who worked with lime-based plastering was brought in. The plasterer ensured the integrity of the beautiful ceiling was honored and restored down to the individual cornices at the wall-to-ceiling junctions, which were custom-molded to match perfectly with the original lime plaster. The walnut paneling in the old general manager’s office was restored by a special tradesman. The main bank vault and the bronze vault boxes were specially cleaned, recast, and were given replacement parts where it was needed by experts. And on the exterior of the building, the stonework restoration was completed by specialized stonemasons.

Finding these uniquely-skilled subcontractors and the budget for each was a key part of making the project work. While it wasn’t easy, we’d always known that would be a necessary factor in honoring the heritage of the building. What we didn’t foresee was the arrival of a global pandemic—and the challenges that would come along with it. Working with very specific materials, things we couldn’t simply swap out for an alternative, meant supply chain disruptions were a major factor. The team worked hard to get what was needed, though, and the project marched on. And when site access was limited, technology and the use of virtual surveys kept the entire team in the loop.

<h4>PRESERVING THE PAST, SECURING THE FUTURE</h4>
In October 2021, after three years of meticulous refurbishment, the grand neoclassical building opposite Centenary Square in the heart of Birmingham again opened its doors—this time as The Exchange.

Every room within the building stands as a testament to both form and function, honoring the history of the space while ushering in an exciting future. The three-story banking hall has been restored to its original grandeur and once again welcomes the community as a café where visitors can enjoy a coffee or meal while marveling at the polished limestone walls, the ornately carved roundels, and original “Saving is the mother of all riches” inscription in the coffered ceiling—now illuminated by a skylight. Downstairs, the basement vaults house public-facing exhibitions. With each rotating exhibit, new purpose pulses through the old safe deposit box rooms. Each of the meeting and event rooms is flexible in use and entirely unique in character, reflecting original details from past lives as a general manager’s office, a staff canteen, and a boardroom. A student incubation center that supports young people's first business enterprises recalls the bank's role in helping community members build their future. Throughout the building, rooms are named for prominent Birmingham residents and university alumni, honoring figures who transformed the school and the city. And on the exterior, the south-facing extension opens onto the newly landscaped Bank Court, creating a new public outdoor gathering space.

To simply restore the space would have been a major accomplishment. But by carrying it into the future and reinvigorating this square in the heart of the city, the project team and the university have done so much more. It was an honor to play a role in that work, and we look forward to seeing The Exchange serve the University of Birmingham and the city’s residents for years to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="size-regular">Sourced from <a href="https://interiordesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interior Design Magazine</a>, By Edie Cohen</p>
<em>October 5, 2022</em>
<p class="size-regular">When TikTok touched down on American shores, i.e. <a href="https://interiordesign.net/projects/tiktok-arrives-stateside-in-a-gensler-designed-los-angeles-headquarters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles, in 2019</a>, it laid claim to the world’s most downloaded app. The same holds true this year, which is also when the company expanded to Manhattan, staking out 150,000 square feet for 1,000 employees across the five top floors of the 58-story H&amp;M tower—fittingly steps from Broadway and its myriad dance numbers. Now, as then, the Gensler project was led by design director and senior associate Chris Mitchell, who translated some of the West Coast tropes to suit the soul of the city.</p>
<p class="size-regular">The play of the neon elevator lobbies of L.A. have been re-envisioned with LED panels in colors and images representing pizza, yellow cabs, and the Statue of Liberty. In the café, LED tubes abstract the subway map, while, behind the servery counter, climbing ropes reference “Spider Man successfully scaling tall buildings,” Mitchell says, adding that, “The boardroom is a circular space in a square building,” its otherworldly oculus subtly recalling James Turrell’s work. And everywhere, including from multiple balconies, are views stretching from the Empire State Building to the Freedom Tower.</p>
